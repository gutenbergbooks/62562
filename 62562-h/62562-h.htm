The Jewish Historical Society of England,
soon after its establishment, resolved on
the publication of the present volume
as a memorial of Menasseh ben Israel,
whose name must always hold the chief
place on the first page of the history of
the present Anglo-Jewish community.
The Society did me the honour of entrusting me with
the preparation of the work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Menasseh’s tracts have been printed in facsimile. They
have not been reproduced by any photographic process,
but have been entirely reset in types similar to those employed
in the original. Thanks to the resources of the
printing establishment of Messrs. Ballantyne, Hanson &amp;
Co. of Edinburgh, and the taste and care they have devoted
to the work, a much finer effect has been produced
than would have been possible had photography been employed,
while exact fidelity to the originals has not been
sacrificed.</p>

<p class='c007'>To me the preparation of this volume has been a labour
of love. Nothing in the whole course of a very varied
literary career, extending over nearly thirty years, has
fascinated me so much as the story of the Return of the
Jews to England. Its mysteries belong to the highest
regions of historical romance, and it forms a page of history
which is a real acquisition both to the annals of the British
Empire and to that wider and more thrilling panorama
of human activities which depicts the fortunes of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>own co-religionists. I have not, however, spoken the last
word on this subject in the present volume, which is chiefly
concerned with the transaction with Oliver Cromwell in
1655–56 and its proximate causes. I hope to tell the whole
story in detail in another volume, which I have long had
in preparation for the “Jewish Library.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The preliminary essay on the Return of the Jews to
England is in no sense a <em>réchauffé</em> of the papers on the
same subject contributed by me to various periodicals
during the last fifteen years. Those papers were written
at successive stages of an uncompleted investigation. The
present essay is a re-study in the light of all the facts, and
it will be found that some of my former judgments have
been modified, and a few even reversed.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have to thank many friends for their assistance. Mr.
Israel Abrahams very kindly relieved me of the labour of
reading the proofs of the tracts, and made many valuable
suggestions which have added to the completeness and
beauty of the volume. Mr. B. L. Abrahams was good
enough to revise my introduction, and thus saved me from
not a few slips of style and memory. The Rev. S. Levy
has given me useful assistance in preparing the annotations,
and Dr. S. R. Gardiner was good enough to place
at my disposal his unrivalled knowledge of the politics
of the Commonwealth in solving some of the difficulties
in the negotiations of 1655. My acknowledgments are
also due to Miss S. R. Hirsch for the excellent index she
has compiled. Finally, Mme. de Novikoff kindly obtained
for me from the Hermitage Collection at St. Petersburg
an excellent photograph of the alleged portrait of Menasseh
ben Israel by Rembrandt, which I have reproduced, together
with two other better known and more authentic portraits.</p>

Shrouded in the fogs of the North Sea,
the British Isles were, for two centuries
after the Great Expulsion by Edward I.,
little more than a bitter memory to the
Jewish people. In other lands they came
and went, but England was as securely closed
against them as was the Egypt of Danaus to the Greeks.
With the exception of a few adventurous pilgrims who
trickled into the country to enjoy the hospitality of the
Domus Conversorum, they ceased gradually to think of the
land which had been so signal a scene of their mediæval
prosperity and sufferings. The Jewish chroniclers of this
period, while dealing with the politics of other European
countries, have scarcely a word to say of England.</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards the beginning of the sixteenth century the fogs
began to lift, and England once again appeared as a possible
haven to the “tribe of the wandering foot and weary
breast.” The gigantic expulsions from Spain by Ferdinand
and Isabella had created a new Jewish Diaspora under conditions
of the most thrilling romance. The Jewish martyrs
“trekked” in their thousands to all the points of the compass,
fringing the coasts of the Mediterranean with a new
industrious population, founding colonies all over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>Levant as far as the Mesopotamian cradle of their race,
penetrating even to Hindostan in the East, and throwing
outposts on the track of Columbus towards the fabled west.
But this was only the beginning of a more remarkable dispersion.
The men and women who took up the pilgrim’s
staff at the bidding of Torquemada could only go where
Jews were tolerated, for they refused to bear false witness
to their ancient religion. They left behind them in Spain
and Portugal a less scrupulous contingent of their race—wealthy
Jews who were disinclined to make sacrifices for
the faith of their fathers, and who accepted the conditions
of the Inquisition rather than abandon their rich
plantations in Andalusia and their palaces in Saragossa,
Toledo, and Seville. They embraced Christianity, but their
conversion was only simulated, and for two centuries they
preserved in secret their allegiance to Judaism. These
Crypto-Jews, in their turn, gradually spread all over Europe,
penetrating in their disguise into countries and towns and
even guilds which the Church had jealously guarded against
all heretical intrusion. It was chiefly through them that
the modern Anglo-Jewish community was founded.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Iberian Crypto-Jews, or Marranos,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a> as they were
called, represented one of the strangest and most romantic
movements in the religious history of Europe. Marranism
was an attempt by the Jews to outwit the Jesuits with their
own weapons. Both sides acted on the principle that the
end justified the means, and each employed the most unscrupulous
guile to defend itself against the other. The
Inquisition was ruthless in its methods to stamp out Judaism,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>the Marranos were equally unprincipled in preserving their
allegiance to their proscribed religion. Abandoning their
ceremonial, abandoning even the racial limitation on marriage,
the Jewish tradition was maintained by secret conventicles
chiefly composed of males, and thus Jewish blood
and the Jewish heresy became distributed all over the
peninsula, and crept into the highest ranks of the nation.
The Court, the Church, the army, even the dread tribunals
of the Holy Office itself were not free from the taint.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> A
secretary to the Spanish king, a vice-chancellor of Aragon,
nearly related to the Royal House, a Lord High Treasurer,
a Court Chamberlain, and an Archdeacon of Coimbra figure
in the lists of discovered Marranos preserved by the Inquisition.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
At Rome the Crypto-Jews commissioned a
secret agent supplied with ample funds, who bribed the
Cardinals, intrigued against the Holy Office, and frequently
obtained the ear of the Pontiff.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Some idea of the social
ramifications of the Marranos is afforded by the careers of
the early members of the Amsterdam Jewish community.
Many of them were men of high distinction who had
escaped from Spain and Portugal in order to throw off
the burden of their imposture. Such were the ex-monk
Vicente de Rocamora, who had been confessor to the Empress
of Germany when she was the Infanta Maria; the
ex-Jesuit father, Tomas de Pinedo, one of the leading
philologists of his day; Enriquez de Paz, a captain in the
army, a Knight of San Miguel, and a famous dramatist;
Colonel Nicolas de Oliver y Fullana, poet, strategist, and
royal cartographer; Don Francesco de Silva, Marquis of
Montfort, who had fought against Marshal de Créqui under
the Emperor Leopold; and Balthasar Orobio de Castro,
physician to the Spanish Court, professor at the University
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>of Salamanca, and a Privy Councillor.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a> It was by Jews
of this class that the congregations of Amsterdam, Hamburg,
and Antwerp were founded, and it was largely through
them that those towns in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
were enabled to wrest from Spain her primacy in the
colonial trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>At a very early epoch Marranos reached England. We
hear of them, almost immediately<a id='txiv'></a> after the expulsion from
Spain, figuring in a lawsuit in London.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a> In 1550 a Marrano
physician was discovered living in London. Another,
Roderigo Lopes, was court physician to Queen Elizabeth,
and the original of Shakespeare’s Shylock.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> When the Earl
of Essex, after the sacking of Cadiz in 1596, brought the
Spanish Resident, Alonzo de Herrera, a prisoner to England,
he turned out to be a Marrano. After his liberation, this
descendant of the great Captain Gonsalvo de Cordova proceeded
to Amsterdam, entered the synagogue, and spent
his old age in the compilation of cabalistical treatises.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
Amador de los Rios states that the Marranos founded secret
settlements in London, Dover, and York;<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> and it has been
shown that they possessed a secret synagogue in London
early in the seventeenth century, if not before.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a> As in
Amsterdam and Antwerp, they were largely concerned in
the development of the Spanish trade, in the importation of
bullion, and in the promotion of commercial relations with
the Levant and the New World.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the people of England were unconscious of this
immigration, it could not have been altogether unknown in
the continental Jewries. That no trace of this knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>is to be found in printed Hebrew literature is not strange,
since the keeping of the secret was a common Jewish interest.
It no doubt helped to stimulate Jewish hopes of a return to
England, which more public circumstances had already
founded. The Reformation in England first turned Jewish
eyes towards the land from which they had been so long
excluded. They were especially interested by Henry
VIII.’s appeal to Jewish scholars during his conflict with
the Papacy in regard to his divorce from Catherine of
Aragon.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Still more deeply must their feelings have
been stirred by Elizabeth’s struggle with Spain. All over
Europe, indeed, Jewish sympathies were with Elizabeth.
The secret negotiations carried on by Roderigo Lopes,
through his influential Marrano relatives, with the Grand
Turk and with the Hebrew bankers of Antwerp and Leghorn,
have yet to be made public; but it is certain that
they played an important part in the story which culminated
in the confusion of the Great Armada. But it was the
increasing Hebraism of English religious thought, as represented
by the Puritan movement, which chiefly attracted
the Jews. This movement sent not a few Englishmen and
Englishwomen to the continental ghettos to seek instruction
at the feet of Hebrew Rabbis, and even to obtain
entrance to the synagogue as proselytes.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a> When the Commonwealth,
with its pronounced Judaical tendencies, emerged
from this movement, the Jews could not fail to be impressed.
The more mystical among them began to dream
of the Golden Age. Indeed the doctrines of the Fifth
Monarchy Men, carried to Smyrna by Puritan merchants,
paved the way for the rise of the pseudo-Messiah, Sabbethai
Zevi.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> The more practical saw that the time had
arrived when it might be reasonably hoped to obtain the
revocation of Edward I.’s edict of banishment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>Towards the end of 1655, the question of the readmission
of the Jews to England was brought to a climax by
Menasseh ben Israel’s famous mission to Oliver Cromwell.
The story of this mission has been briefly narrated by
Menasseh himself in the <em>Vindiciæ Judæorum</em>, one of the
tracts printed in the present volume.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a> As my object in
this preliminary essay is to set forth the story more fully,
and to endeavour to elucidate its obscurities, I cannot do
better than take as my text this authoritative, though somewhat
vague, statement by the chief actor in the events with
which I am dealing. Here is what Menasseh wrote under
date of April 10, 1656:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“The communication and correspondence I have held for
some years since, with some eminent persons of <em>England</em>, was
the first originall of my undertaking this design. For I alwayes
found by them, a great probability of obtaining what I now
request, whilst they affirmed that at this time the minds of men
stood very well affected towards us, and that our entrance into
this Island would be very acceptable and well pleasing unto them.
And from this beginning sprang up in me a semblable affection,
and desire of obtaining this purpose. For, for seven yeares
on this behalf, I have endeavoured and sollicited it, by letters
and other means, without any intervall. For I conceived that our
universall dispersion was a necessary circumstance, to be fulfilled
before all that shall be accomplished which the Lord hath promised
to the people of the <em>Jewes</em>, concerning their restauration,
and their returning again into their own land, according to those
words, <em>Dan.</em> 12,7: <em>When we shall have accomplished to scatter
the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished</em>. As
also, that this our scattering, by little, and little, should be amongst
all people, <em>from the one end of the earth even unto the other</em>, as it
is written <em>Deut.</em> 28,64: I conceived that <em>by the end of the earth</em>
might be understood this <em>Island</em>. And I knew not, but that the
Lord who often works by naturall meanes, might have design’d
and made choice of me for the bringing about this work. With
these proposals therefore, I applyed my self, in all zealous affection
to the <em>English Nation</em>, congratulating their glorious liberty which
at this day they enjoy; together with their prosperous peace.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>And I entituled my book named <cite>The Hope of Israel</cite>, to the first
Parliament, and the Council of State. And withall declared my
intentions. In order to which they sent me a very favorable
passe-port. Afterwards I directed my self to the second, and
they also sent me another. But at that juncture of time my
coming was not presently performed, for that my kindred and
friends, considering the checquered, and interwoven vicissitudes,
and turns of things here below, embracing me, with pressing importunity,
earnestly requested me not to part from them, and
would not give over, till their love constrained me to promise,
that I would yet awhile stay with them. But notwithstanding all
this, I could not be at quiet in my mind (I know not but that it
might be through some particular divine providence) till I had
anew made my humble addresses to his Highnesse the Lord Protector
(whom God preserve), and finding that my coming over
would not be altogether unwelcome to him, with those great hopes
which I conceived, I joyfully took my leave of my house, my friends,
my kindred, all my advantages there, and the country wherein I
have lived all my lifetime, under the benign protection, and favour
of the Lords, the States Generall, and Magistrates of <em>Amsterdam</em>;
<em>in fine</em> (I say) I parted with them all, and took my voyage for
<em>England</em>. Where, after my arrivall, being very courteously received,
and treated with much respect, I presented to his most
Serene Highnesse a petition, and some desires, which for the
most part, were written to me by my brethren the <em>Jewes</em>, from
severall parts of <em>Europe</em>, as your worship may better understand
by former relations. Whereupon it pleased His Highnesse to
convene an Assembly at <em>Whitehall</em>, of Divines, Lawyers, and
Merchants, of different persuasions, and opinions. Whereby
men’s judgements, and sentences were different. Insomuch, that
as yet, we have had no finall determination from his most Serene
Highnesse. Wherefore those few <em>Jewes</em> that were here, despairing
of our expected successe, departed hence. And others who
desired to come hither, have quitted their hopes, and betaken
themselves some to <em>Italy</em>, some to <em>Geneva</em>, where that Commonwealth
hath at this time, most freely granted them many, and
great privileges.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>
  <h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>II. The Hope of Israel</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The first point in Menasseh’s story which needs elucidation
is his statement that he was originally induced to
move in the question of the resettlement of the Jews by
the assurances of “some eminent persons of England,”
that “the minds of men stood very well affected towards
us.” How had this philo-Semitic sentiment arisen, and
who were the men who had communicated it to the Amsterdam
Rabbi?</p>

<p class='c007'>The evolution of English thought which rendered
Menasseh ben Israel’s enterprise possible is of considerable
complexity, but its main features are easily distinguishable.
The idea of Religious Liberty in England was
due, in its broader aspects, to the struggle between the
Baptists and the Calvinists. The Reformation established
only a restricted form of Religious Liberty, and it was not
until the Baptists found themselves persecuted as the Reformers
had been before them, that the cry arose for a
liberty of conscience which would embrace all religions. In
the Separatist Churches, founded by English refugees in
Amsterdam and Geneva, the idea grew and strengthened.
The earliest noteworthy tract on the subject—Leonard
Busher’s “Religious Peace, or a Plea for Liberty of Conscience,”
published in 1614—was written under the influence
of these exiles, and it is noteworthy that already in
that work the extension of religious liberty to Jews was
specifically demanded.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Amsterdam was at that time the
seat of a flourishing Jewish community, some of whose
members came into contact with the philo-Jewish refugees.
In this way they probably learnt to understand the political
significance of the successive rise of the Puritans and Independents,
for at the very beginning of the Civil War the
Royalist spies in Holland noted that the Jews sympathised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>with the Republicans, and even alleged that they had offered
them “considerable sums of money to carry on their designs.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The progress of Religious Liberty in the seventeenth
century reached its highest point, when in 1645 the Independents
captured the Army under the scheme known
as the “New Model.” Meanwhile Roger Williams, the
famous Baptist, who had already founded in America a
community based on unrestricted liberty of conscience, had
published his “Bloudy Tenent of Persecution,” in which
he generously pleaded for the Jews.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a> In 1646 a reprint of
Leonard Busher’s pamphlet was published in London, much
to the joy of the Separatists in Amsterdam,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a> and a year
later Hugh Peters, one of Cromwell’s Army Chaplains,
wrote his “Word for the Army and Two Words for the
Kingdom,” in which he proposed that “strangers, even
Jews [be] admitted to trade and live with us.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a> The
question of the readmission of the Jews was, however, still
far from taking practical shape. Although frequently referred
to, it had only been raised incidentally as an illustration
of the advanced tendencies of the advocates of Religious
Liberty.</p>

<p class='c007'>In December 1648, the Independents contrived the
famous “Pride’s Purge,” which put an end to the Presbyterian
domination of Parliament. The hopes of the advocates
of Religious Liberty ran high, and the Jewish question
at once came to the front. The Council of Mechanics,
meeting at Whitehall, marked their sense of the meaning
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’état</span></i> by immediately voting “a toleration of
all religions whatsoever, not excepting Turkes, nor Papists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>nor Jewes.”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a> To this the Council of Army Officers responded
with a resolution, the text of which has, unfortunately,
not been preserved, in which they favoured the
widest scheme of Religious Liberty. It was, indeed,
rumoured at the time that the Jews were specifically mentioned
in the resolution.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a> However that may be, it is
certain that in the following month two Baptists of Amsterdam,
Johanna Cartwright and her son Ebenezer, were
encouraged to present a petition to Lord Fairfax and the
General Council of Officers, in which they asked that “the
statute of banishment” against the Jews might be repealed.
The petition, we are told, was “favourably received, with
a promise to take it into speedy consideration when the
present more public affairs are dispatched.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately, the “more public affairs” obstructed the
triumph of Religious Liberty, and with it the Jewish cause,
for a good many years. In the same month that Mrs. Cartwright’s
petition was considered, Charles I. was beheaded,
and the chiefs of the Revolution, with a great work of
reconstruction before them, felt that they must proceed
cautiously. Toleration of the Jews meant unrestricted
liberty of conscience, and this was held by the extreme Independents
to imply not only the abolition of an Established
Church, but a licence to the multitude of sects—many of
them of the maddest and most blasphemous tendencies—which
had been hatched by Laudian persecution and the
reaction of the Civil War. Cromwell and his advisers were
resolved to pursue a more conservative policy, and the toleration
plans of the Independents were accordingly shelved.
For a hundred years—until, indeed, Pelham’s “Jew Bill”
in 1753—they were not heard of in this purely secular
shape again.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>The cause of Religious Liberty was, however, not the
only force which was working in the country for the readmission
of the Jews. The religious fervour of the nation
had been stirred to a high pitch, and there were few men
whose minds had not become influenced by Messianic and
other mystical beliefs. It is curious indeed to note that
this current of thought ran parallel with the evolution of
the secular idea of Toleration. Seven years after the first
publication of Leonard Busher’s famous Toleration pamphlet,
Mr. Sergeant Finch wrote anonymously a book
entitled “The Calling of the Jewes” (1621), with a prefatory
epistle in Hebrew, in which he invited the children
of Israel to realise the prophecies by asserting their national
existence in Palestine. At the same time he called upon
all Christian princes to do homage to the Jewish nation.
This early manifestation of Zionism did not meet with
much sympathy in high places, for James I. was so incensed
at it that he clapped its publisher into jail.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a> The book,
however, was a symptom, and the movement it represented
only derived strength from persecution. The gloomier the
lot of the sectaries, the more intense became their reliance
on the Messianic prophecies. Even after the triumph of
the Puritan cause, the sanest Independents held to them
firmly side by side with their belief in Religious Liberty;
and in the Cartwright petition we find both views expounded.
Extremists like the Fifth Monarchy Men made them the
pivots for fresh outbursts of Sectarianism. Judaical sects
arose, the members of which endeavoured to live according
to the Levitical Law, even practising circumcision. Prosecutions
for such practices may be traced back to 1624.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
Some of the saints, like Everard the Leveller, publicly called
themselves Jews;<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a> others went to Amsterdam, and were
formally received into the synagogue.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a> Colchester was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>headquarters of one of these Judaical sects, but there were
others in London and in Wales.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a> The practical effect of
this movement was not only the production of a very widespread
philo-Semitism, but a strong conviction that, inasmuch
as the conversion of the Jews was an indispensable
preliminary of the Millennium, their admission to England,
where they might meet the godliest people in the world,
was urgently necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was this feeling which, on the collapse of the Toleration
movement in 1649, began to make itself most loudly
heard. Edward Nicholas, John Sadler, John Dury, Henry
Jessey, Roger Williams, and even Thomas Fuller, who was
far from being a mystic, urged this view on the public, and
an agitation for the Readmission of the Jews, as a religious
duty outside the problem of Religious Liberty, was set on
foot. This mystical agitation found a response in what to us
must at first sight appear a strangely inappropriate quarter.
It brought forth from Amsterdam a Latin pamphlet,
entitled “Spes Israelis,” with a prefatory address “To the
Parliament, the Supreme Court of England,” the author of
which was Menasseh ben Israel, one of the Rabbis of the
congregation. This pamphlet illustrates the inception of
the enterprise for the Resettlement of the Jews in England,
which its author endeavoured to carry out six years later.</p>

<p class='c007'>Menasseh ben Israel was the son of a Marrano of Lisbon,
who had suffered at the hands of the Inquisition, and had,
as a result, taken up his abode in Amsterdam. Menasseh
was educated under the care of Rabbi Isaac Uziel, and, at
the age of eighteen, was ordained a Rabbi. He was an indefatigable
student, became a mine of learning, an accomplished
linguist, a fluent writer, and a voluble preacher.
His attainments made considerable noise in the world, at a
time when public attention was riveted on Biblical prophecy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>and the question of its fulfilment through the Jews.
His voluminous writings obtained for him a high reputation
as a scholar, and the readiness with which he
afforded information to all who corresponded with him
made him many influential friends, who spread his fame
far and wide. The secret of the distinction Menasseh
secured for himself, in spite of the weaknesses of his character
and the eccentricity of his mental tendency, lies in the
fact that the world in which he lived was very largely given
over to philo-Semitism, and to the special form of mysticism
to which he had yielded himself. His alliance with a scion
of the Abarbanel family, in whose tradition of Davidic
descent he was a firm believer, inspired him with the idea
that he was destined to promote the coming of the Messiah;
and hence the wild dreams of the English Millenarians
appealed to him with something of a personal force. It was
not, however, until the triumph of the Republican cause in
England that he resolved to throw in his lot with the
Puritan mystics, and even then he had some difficulty, as
we may readily believe, in adopting an attitude which would
at once conciliate the English Conversionists, and harmonise
with his allegiance to the synagogue.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>At first his sympathies, like those of most of the leading
members of the Amsterdam community, seem to have been
Royalist, for in 1642 we find him extolling the queen of
Charles I. in an oration.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a> In 1647 he was still far from
recognising in the Puritan revolt a movement calling for
his Messianic sympathy; for, writing to an English friend
in that year, he described the Civil War, not, as he afterwards
believed it to be, as a struggle of the godly against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>ungodly, but as a Divine punishment for the expulsion of
his co-religionists from Britain in the thirteenth century.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a>
This letter is interesting as showing that his mind was
then already beginning to be exercised by the Resettlement
question; but he evidently had as yet no definite idea of
taking any practical action. In the autumn of 1649 a
method of action was suggested to him by a letter he received
from the well-known English Puritan, John Dury,
whose acquaintance he had made in Amsterdam five years
previously.</p>

<p class='c007'>A friend of John Dury, one Thomas Thorowgood, was
deeply interested in the missionary labours of the famous
evangelist, John Eliot, among the American Indians; and
in order to prevail upon the philo-Jewish public to provide
money for the support of the mission, had compiled a
treatise showing that the American Indians were the Lost
Tribes. This work was largely founded on the conjectures
of the early Spanish missionaries, who had up to that time
a monopoly of this solution of the Ten Tribes problem.
It was written in 1648, and dedicated to the King, but the
renewal of the Civil War in that year prevented its publication.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
Thorowgood thereupon sent the proofs of the
first part of the work to John Dury to read. It happened
that Dury, while at the Hague in 1644, had heard
some stories about the Ten Tribes which had very much
interested him. One was to the effect that a Jew, named
Antonio de Montezinos, or Aaron Levy, had, while travelling
in South America, met a race of savages in the Cordilleras,
who recited the <em>Shema</em>,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a> practised Jewish ceremonies,
and were, in short, Israelites of the Tribe of Reuben.
Montezinos had related his story to Menasseh ben Israel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>and had even embodied it in an affidavit executed under
oath before the chiefs of the Amsterdam Synagogue. As
soon as Dury received Thorowgood’s treatise, he remembered
this story, and at once wrote to Menasseh ben Israel
for a copy of the affidavit. The courteous Rabbi sent it to
him by return of post,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a> and it was printed for the first time
as an appendix to an instalment of Thorowgood’s treatise,
which, at Dury’s instance, was published in January 1650.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This incident, coupled with some letters he received
from the notorious Millenarian, Nathaniel Holmes, came
as a ray of light to Menasseh. For five years he had had
Montezinos’s narrative by him, and had not regarded it as of
sufficient importance to publish. He had, perhaps, doubted
the wisdom of publishing it, seeing that it tended to substantiate
a theory of purely Jesuitical origin, for which
no sanction could be found in Jewish records or legend.
Moreover, he had no strong views on the prophetical bearing
of the question, as we may see by a letter he addressed to
Holmes as late as the previous summer, in which he stated
that he had grave doubts as to the time and manner of the
coming of the Messiah.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c015'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Now, however, the question began
to grow clear to him, and it dawned upon him that the long-neglected
narrative of Montezinos might be used for a
better purpose than the support of Christian missions in
New England. The story was, if true, a proof of the increasing
dispersion of Israel. Daniel had foretold that the
scattering of the Holy People would be the forerunner of
their Restoration, and a verse in Deuteronomy had explained
that the scattering would be “from one end of
the earth even to the other end of the earth.” It was clear
from Montezinos and other travellers that they had already
reached one end of the earth. Let them enter England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>and the other end would be attained. Thus the promises
of the Almighty would be fulfilled, and the Golden Age
would dawn. “I knew not,” he wrote later on, “but that
the Lord who often works by naturall meanes, might have
design’d, and made choice of me, for bringing about this
work.”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c015'><sup>[37]</sup></a> In this hope he wrote the famous <span lang='iw' xml:lang='ar' dir='rtl'>מקוה ישראל</span> which
in 1650 burst on the British public under the title of the
“Hope of Israel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The central idea of this booklet did not occur to
Menasseh immediately on receiving John Dury’s letter.
His first intention, as he explained in a letter dated November
25, 1649, was to write a treatise on the Dispersion of
the Ten Tribes for the information of Dury and his friends.
The volume, however, grew under his pen, and a week later
he announced to Dury his larger plan. His letter gives a
complete synopsis of the work, and he finishes up by informing
Dury that “I prove at large that the day of the
promised Messiah unto us doth draw near.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c015'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Thus he had
already made up his mind on a question which, only a few
months before, he had assured Holmes was “uncertain,”
and was intended to be uncertain. Holmes was at the
time unaware of his conversion, for, on December 24, he
wrote to him an expostulatory letter, in which, curiously
enough, he advised him to study the Danielic Prophecies.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a>
Still, Menasseh does not seem to have fully grasped the
application of his treatise to the Resettlement question, for
neither in the body of the work nor in the Spanish edition
does he refer to it. It was only when he composed the
Latin edition that his scheme reached maturity. To that
edition he prefixed a dedication to the English Parliament,
eulogising its stupendous achievements, and supplicating
“your favour and good-will to our nation now scattered
almost all over the earth.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>The tract produced a profound impression throughout
England. That an eminent Jewish Rabbi should bless the
new Republican Government, and should bear testimony to
its having “done great things valiantly,” was peculiarly
gratifying to the whole body of Puritans. To the Millenarians
and other sectaries it was a source of still deeper
satisfaction, for their wild faith now received the sanction
of one of the Chosen People, a sage of Israel, of the Seed
of the Messiah. Besides the Latin edition which Dury distributed
among all the leading Puritans, and which was
probably read in Parliament, two English editions issued
anonymously by Moses Wall were rapidly sold. Nevertheless,
its effect proved transitory. Sober politicians, who
still recognised that the new-fledged Republic had, as Fairfax
said, “more public affairs” to despatch than the Jewish
question, had begun to fear lest their hands might be forced
by Menasseh’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></i>. This feeling was strikingly reflected
in a tract by Sir Edward Spencer, one of the members of
Parliament for Middlesex. Addressing himself with feline
affection “to my deare brother, Menasseh ben Israel, the
Hebrewe Philosopher,” he expressed his readiness to agree
to the admission of the Jews on twelve conditions artfully
designed to strengthen the hands of the sectaries who believed
that, besides the dispersion of the Jews, their conversion
was also a necessary condition of the Millennium.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
Spencer’s tract was the signal for a revulsion of feeling.
Sadler, afterwards one of Menasseh’s firmest friends, threw
doubts on the authenticity of Montezinos’s story,<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a> and Fuller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>did not scruple to criticise the Zionist theory on practical
grounds.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a> Even the faithful Jessey held his peace in tacit
sympathy with Spencer’s scheme. As for Menasseh, he
showed no disposition to acquiesce in Spencer’s proposals.
The result was that the sensation gradually died away,
though a few stalwart Tolerationists like Hugh Peters still
clamoured for unconditional Readmission.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Thus both the Toleration and Messianic movements
proved unavailing for the purposes of the Jewish Restoration.
There remained a third view of the question which
made less noise in the world, but which was destined to
bring about gradually and silently a real and lasting solution—the
view of Political Expediency.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>III. Cromwell’s Policy</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>The statesmen of the Commonwealth, who knew so
well how to conjure with human enthusiasm, were essentially
practical men. To imagine that they were the slaves of
the great religious revival which had enabled them to overcome
the loyalist inspiration of the cavaliers is entirely to
misconceive their character and aims. The logical outcome
of that revival, and of the triumph of the Puritan arms,
would have been the Kingdom of Saints, but Cromwell’s
ambition aimed at something much more conventional.
Imperial expansion and trade ascendency filled a larger
place in his mind than the Other-worldly inspirations which
had carried him to power.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the unrestricted Toleration principles of the Baptists
he had no sympathy, and still less with the Messianic
phantasies of the Fifth Monarchy Men which Menasseh
ben Israel had virtually embraced. His ideas on Religious
Liberty were certainly large and far in advance of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>times,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a> but they were essentially the ideas of a churchman.
Their limits are illustrated by his ostentatious patronage
in 1652 of Owens’ scheme of a Toleration confined to
Christians.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a> Still he was not the slave of these limits.
The ingenious distinction he drew between the Papistry of
France and that of Spain, when it became necessary for him
to choose between them, and his complete disregard of the
same principles in the case of the Portuguese alliance, show
how readily he subordinated his strongest religious prejudices
to political exigencies. As for the mystics and
ultra-democrats, his views were set forth very clearly in
his speech to the new Parliament in September 1651, when
he opposed the Millenarians, the Judaisers, and the
Levellers by name.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a> It is impossible for any one reading
this speech side by side with Menasseh ben Israel’s tracts
to believe that the author of it had any sympathy with the
wilder motives actuating the Jewish Rabbi.</p>

<p class='c007'>What was it, then, that brought these two different
characters so closely together? That the Readmission of
the Jews to England was one of Cromwell’s own schemes—part
and parcel of that dream of Imperial expansion
which filled his latter days with its stupendous adumbration
and vanished so tragically with his early death—it
is impossible to doubt. We have no record of his views
on the subject, beyond a short and ambiguous abstract of
his speech at the Whitehall Conferences, but there is ample
evidence that he was the mainspring of the whole movement,
and that Menasseh was but a puppet in his hands.
His main motives are not difficult to guess. Cromwell’s
statecraft was, as I have said, not entirely or even essentially
governed by religious policy. He desired to make England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>great and prosperous, as well as pious and free, and for
these purposes he had to consider the utility of his subjects
even before he weighed their orthodoxy. Now the Jews
could not but appeal to him as very desirable instruments
of his colonial and commercial policy. They controlled
the Spanish and Portuguese trade; they had the Levant
trade largely in their hands; they had helped to found the
Hamburg Bank, and they were deeply interested in the
Dutch East and West Indian companies. Their command
of bullion, too, was enormous, and their interest in shipping
was considerable.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a> Moreover, he knew something personally
of the Jews, for he was acquainted with some of the
members of the community of Marranos then established
in London, and they had proved exceedingly useful to him
as contractors and intelligencers.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a> There is, indeed, reason
to believe that some of these Marranos had been brought
into the country by the Parliamentary Government as early
as 1643 with the specific object of supplying the pecuniary
necessities of the new administration.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c015'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Until the end of 1651 the Readmission question presented
no elements of urgency, because there was a chance of
its favourable solution without its being made the object of
a special effort on the part of the Government or the legislature.
By the treaty of coalition proposed to the Netherlands
by the St. John mission early in 1651, the Jewish
question would have solved itself, for the Hebrew merchants
of Amsterdam would have <em>ipso facto</em> acquired in England
the same rights as they enjoyed in Holland. That proposal,
however, broke down, and as a result the famous
Navigation Act was passed. The object of that measure
was to exclude foreign nations from the colonial trade, and
to dethrone the Dutch from their supremacy in the carrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>and distributing traffic of Europe. Consequently it supplied
a strong inducement to Jewish merchants—especially
those of Amsterdam who were then trading with Jamaica
and Barbados—to transfer their counting-houses to London.
As such an immigration would have well served the policy
embodied in the Navigation Act, it became desirable that
some means of legalising Jewish residence in England should
be found, and hence the question of Readmission was
brought within the field of practical politics. This was
the new form in which it presented itself. It was no
longer a question of Religious Toleration or of the hastening
of the Millennium, but purely a question of political
expediency.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears that the St. John mission, when its failure
became probable, was instructed to study the Jewish question,
and probably to enter into negotiations with leading
Jews in Amsterdam. Certain it is that its members saw a
great deal of Menasseh ben Israel during their sojourn in
Holland, and that Cromwell’s benevolent intentions were conveyed
to him. Thurloe, who was secretary to the mission,
had several conferences with the Rabbi, and the Synagogue
entertained the members of the mission, notwithstanding
that public opinion ran high against them.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a> Strickland,
the colleague of St. John, and formerly ambassador at the
Hague, was ever afterwards regarded as an authority on the
Jewish question, for he served on most of the Committees
appointed to consider Menasseh’s petitions. Still more significant
is the fact that within a few weeks of the return of
the Embassy a letter, the text of which has not been preserved,
was received from Menasseh by the Council of State,
and an influential committee, on which Cromwell himself
served, was at once appointed to peruse and answer it.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a>
Towards the end of the following year two passes couched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>in flattering terms were issued to the Rabbi to enable him
to come to England.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, the long-feared war broke out, and negotiations
were perforce suspended. From 1652 to 1654 the
popular agitation for the Readmission of the Jews spluttered
weakly in pamphlets and broadsheets. In 1653 there was a
debate in Parliament on the subject, but no conclusion was
arrived at.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a> In the following year, shortly after the conclusion
of peace, a new element was introduced into the
question by the appearance on the scene of a fresh petitioner
from Holland, one Manuel Martinez Dormido, a brother-in-law
of Menasseh ben Israel, and afterwards well known
in England as David Abarbanel Dormido.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mission of Dormido was clearly a continuation of
Menasseh’s enterprise, and it was probably undertaken on
the direct invitation of the Protector. With the restoration
of peace on terms which rendered persistence in the
policy of the Navigation Act indispensable, Cromwell must
have been anxious to take the Jewish question seriously in
hand. The negotiations opened by Thurloe with Menasseh
in 1651 were probably resumed, and an intimation was
conveyed to the Jewish Rabbi that the time was ripe for
him to come to England and lay his long-contemplated
prayer before the Government of the Commonwealth.
Menasseh’s reasons for not accepting the invitation in
person are not difficult to understand. He doubtless refers
to them in the passage from the <em>Vindiciæ</em> I have already
quoted, where he says he was entreated by his kindred and
friends, “considering the chequered and interwoven vicissitudes
and turns of things here below, not to part from
them.”<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c015'><sup>[54]</sup></a> His kindred and friends were wise. Owing to
his quarrels with his colleagues in the Amsterdam Rabbinate
his situation had become precarious, and it might have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>become hopelessly and disastrously compromised had he, in
the then incensed state of Dutch feeling against England—a
feeling in which the leading Jews of the Netherlands participated—undertaken
a mission to the Protector. Hence
the delegation of the work to his brother-in-law. An indication
of Menasseh’s interest in the new mission is afforded
by the fact that his only surviving son, Samuel ben Israel,
was associated with Dormido, and accompanied him to
London.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unlike his distinguished relative, Dormido had nothing
to lose by approaching Cromwell. A Marrano by birth, a
native of Andalusia, where he had enjoyed great wealth and
held high public office, he had been persecuted by the Inquisition,
and compelled to fly to Holland. There he had
made a fortune in the Brazil trade, and had become a leading
merchant of Amsterdam, and one of the chiefs of the
Synagogue. The conquest of Pernambuco by the Portuguese
early in 1654 had ruined him, and he found himself
compelled to begin life afresh.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a> He saw his opportunity
in the mission confided to him by Menasseh. It opened
to him the chance of a new career under the powerful protection
of the greatest personality in Christendom. Unlike
his brother-in-law, he had no Millenarian delusions. The
Jewish question appealed to him in something of the same
practical fashion that it appealed to Cromwell. While the
Protector was seeking the commercial interests of the
Commonwealth, Dormido was anxious to repair his own
shattered fortunes.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 1st September he arrived in London, and at
once set about drafting two petitions to Cromwell.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c015'><sup>[56]</sup></a> In the
first of these documents he recited his personal history, the
story of his sufferings at the hands of the Inquisition, and
of the confiscation of his property by the Portuguese in
Pernambuco. He expressed his desire to become a resident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv'>xxxiv</span>in England and a subject of the Commonwealth, and wound
up by praying the Protector to use his good offices with the
King of Portugal for the restitution of his fortune. The
second petition was a prayer for the Readmission of the
Jewish people to England, “graunting them libertie to come
with theire famillies and estates, to bee dwellers here with
the same eaquallnese and conveniences wch yr inland borne
subjects doe enjoy.” The petition, after a violent tirade
against the Inquisition and the intolerance of the Apostolical
Roman Church, pointed out that the Readmission of
the Jews would be to the advantage of trade and industry,
and would vastly increase the public revenues. These adroit
appeals to the chief motives of the Protector’s statecraft
were followed by a suggestion that in the event of the
prayer being granted the petitioner might be appointed to
the control and management of the new community, with,
of course, appropriate compensation for his services.</p>

<p class='c007'>Despite their obviously selfish motives, Cromwell received
these petitions with significant graciousness. They
were at once sent to the Council, with an endorsement,
stating that “His Highnes is pleased in an especiall
manner to recommend these two annexed papers to the
speedy consideracion of the Councell, that the Peticion may
receive all due satisfacion and withall convenient speed.”
It is impossible not to be struck by the pressing nature of
this recommendation, when it is considered that the chief
petition dealt with a very large and important political
question, and that its signatory was a man wholly unknown
in England. Cromwell’s action can only be explained by
the theory that he was, as I have suggested, the instigator
of the whole movement. Whether the Council were aware
of this or not is impossible to say. They had as yet no
decided opinions on the subject, but they saw that it was a
large and difficult question, that its bearings were imperfectly
known, and that its decision, either one way or the
other, involved a very serious responsibility at a time when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxv'>xxxv</span>the religious element wielded so much power in the country,
and withal so capriciously. At the personal instigation of
the Protector, however, they consented to appoint a committee
to consider the petitions. A month later, taking
advantage of a meeting at which Cromwell was not present,
the committee verbally reported, and the Council resolved,
that it “saw no excuse to make any order.”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c015'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>That Cromwell was disappointed by this result he
speedily made clear. In regard to the Resettlement petition,
he did not care to take the responsibility of giving a
decision; but on the other petition he took immediate
steps to afford satisfaction to Dormido, in spite of the refusal
of the Council to have anything to do with it. He
addressed an autograph letter to the King of Portugal,
asking him as a personal favour to restore Dormido’s property,
or to make him full compensation for his losses.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c015'><sup>[58]</sup></a>
Seeing that Dormido was an alien, and had absolutely no
claim on the British Government, this personal intervention
by Cromwell on his behalf affords a further strong presumption
of his privity to the Jewish mission. It is also
not a little significant that a few months later the Protector
granted a patent of denization to Antonio Fernandez
Carvajal, the chief of the little Marrano community in
London, and his two sons.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The question was, however, not allowed to rest here.
Cromwell wanted an authoritative decision, which would
enable him to do more than merely protect individual Jews,
and it was clear that this could not be obtained unless a more
important person than Dormido were induced to take the
matter in hand. The question had to be raised to a higher
level, and for this purpose it was necessary that it should
make some noise in the country. Only one European Jew
had sufficient influence in England to stimulate the popular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvi'>xxxvi</span>imagination, and to justify the Government in taking serious
steps for the solution of the question. That man was
the author of the “Hope of Israel.” In May 1655 it was
decided to send Samuel ben Israel back to Amsterdam to
lay the case before his father, and persuade him to come to
London.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c015'><sup>[60]</sup></a> There is no mystery as to who suggested this
step. Menasseh in his diplomatic way merely tells us he
was informed that his “coming over would not be altogether
unwelcome to His Highness the Lord Protector.”<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c015'><sup>[61]</sup></a> There
is, however, a letter extant from John Sadler to Richard
Cromwell, written shortly after Oliver’s death, in which it
is definitely stated that Menasseh was invited “by some
letters of your late royall father.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c015'><sup>[62]</sup></a> Sadler no doubt spoke
from personal knowledge, for in 1654 he was acting as
private secretary to the Protector, and the endorsement on
Dormido’s petitions recommending them to the Council
bears his signature.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a> Under these circumstances we can
well understand that Menasseh was induced, as he says, to
“conceive great hopes,” and that he resolved to undertake
the journey. In October he arrived in London with the
MS. of his famous “Humble Addresses” in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the five months that Menasseh was preparing
for his journey, Cromwell was not idle. Colonial questions
were occupying his mind very largely, and on these questions
he was in the habit of receiving advice from one at
least of the London Marranos, Simon de Caceres, a relative
of Spinoza, and an eminent merchant who had large interests
in the West Indies, and had enjoyed the special favour of
the King of Denmark and the Queen of Sweden.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c015'><sup>[64]</sup></a> It was
no doubt at the instigation of De Caceres that in April
1655 Cromwell sent a Jewish physician, Abraham de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvii'>xxxvii</span>Mercado, with his son Raphael to Barbados.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c015'><sup>[65]</sup></a> Later in the
year he was deep in consultation with De Caceres in regard
to the defences of the newly acquired island of Jamaica, and
a plan for the conquest of Chili.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c015'><sup>[66]</sup></a> The most important
result of these confabulations was a scheme for colonising
Surinam (which since 1650 had been a British colony) with
the Jewish fugitives from Brazil, who had been obliged to
leave Pernambuco and Recife through the Portuguese
reoccupation of those towns. The idea was, no doubt,
suggested by Dormido, himself one of the victims of the
Portuguese conquest. In order to attract the Jews, they
were granted a charter in which full liberty of conscience was
secured to them, together with civil rights, a large measure
of communal autonomy, and important land grants.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c015'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Thus a beginning was made in the solution of the Jewish
question by their admission as citizens to one of the colonial
dependencies of Great Britain. This was the first important
step achieved by Cromwell, and it illustrates at
once his deep interest in the Jewish question, and the practical
considerations which actuated him in seeking its
solution.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>IV. The Appeal to the Nation</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>On his arrival in London, Menasseh, with his retinue of
three Rabbis,<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c015'><sup>[68]</sup></a> was lodged with much ceremony in one
of the houses opposite the New Exchange, in the then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxviii'>xxxviii</span>fashionable Strand, the Piccadilly of its day. These houses
were frequented by distinguished strangers who desired to
be near the centre of official life at Whitehall, and the fact
that Menasseh with his slender purse took up his abode
in one of them, instead of seeking hospitality with his
brother-in-law or his Marrano co-religionists in the city,
shows at once the importance with which his mission was
invested.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c015'><sup>[69]</sup></a> He was the guest of the Protector, bidden to
London to discuss high affairs of state, and as such it was
obviously inadmissible that he should be hidden away in
some obscure address in an East-End Alsatia.</p>

<p class='c007'>His first task after he had settled down in his “study”
in the Strand was to print his “Humble Addresses,” in
which he appealed to the Protector and the Commonwealth
to readmit the Jews, and stated the grounds of his petition.
This tract was written and translated into English long
before he left Amsterdam. It had probably been prepared
three years before, when he first received his passes for
England. That it was in existence at a time when his
final mission was uncontemplated is proved by its mention
in a list of his works he sent to Felgenhauer in February
1655 (<span class='fss'>N.S.</span>).<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c015'><sup>[70]</sup></a> The title is there given as <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Fidelitate
et Utilitate Judaicæ Gentis</span></cite>, and it is described as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libellus
Anglicus</span></i>. This was nine months before he arrived in
London, and three and a half months before his brother-in-law
sent for him. My impression is that the tract was
prepared at the time of the St. John mission in 1651, and
that Menasseh had drafted it in accordance with the advice
of Thurloe, who had pointed out that the faithfulness and
profitableness of the Jewish people were likely to weigh
more with Cromwell than the relation of their dispersion
to the Messianic Age.</p>

<p class='c007'>At any rate, the style and matter of the pamphlet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxix'>xxxix</span>are in welcome contrast to the fantastical theories of the
“Hope of Israel,” resembling more the matter-of-fact
petition of Dormido. The Danielic prophecy is, it is true,
still asserted, but only as an aside, the case for the Readmission
being argued almost exclusively on grounds of
political expediency. Incidentally certain floating calumnies
against the Jews—such as their alleged usury, the slaying
of infants for the Passover, and their conversion of Christians—are
discussed and refuted. In regard to the conversion
of Christians, Menasseh had completely changed
his attitude since writing the “Hope of Israel,” for in that
work he had boasted of the conversions made by the Jews
in Spain.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c015'><sup>[71]</sup></a> The prudent restraints Menasseh had imposed
upon himself in the composition of this pamphlet are the
more marked, since we know that he had in no way
modified his original views as expounded in the “Hope
of Israel.” This is shown by a letter he wrote to Felgenhauer
early in the year, thanking him for dedicating to him
the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bonum Nuncium Israeli</span></cite>, one of the maddest rhapsodies
ever written.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c015'><sup>[72]</sup></a> In this letter he reiterated all his former
views, with the exception of his belief in the imminence
of the Millennium. Nor had he adopted any idea of compromising
the question of the Readmission to meet the
prejudices or fears of the various political and religious
factions in England. His demand was for absolute freedom
of ingress and settlement for all Jews and the unfettered
exercise of their religion, “whiles we expect with you the
Hope of Israel to be revealed.” The necessity of such a
privilege had been the more impressed upon him by the
renewal of the persecutions of his co-religionists in Poland,
which had sent a great wave of destitute Jews westward.
It was primarily for them and for the Marranos of Spain
and Portugal that he hoped to find an unrestricted asylum
in England.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c015'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xl'>xl</span>Until the publication of the “Humble Addresses,”
there are but scanty clues in the printed literature of
the time to the frame of mind in which Menasseh’s mission
found the English public. It would seem, from the silence
of the printing-presses, that the nearer the people approached
the Readmission question as a problem of practical politics,
the less enthusiastic they became for its solution. This is
not difficult to understand. The secular Tolerationists
were unable to make headway against the dangers of unlimited
sectarianism, to which their doctrines seemed calculated
to open the door. Of their chief exponents, Roger
Williams was in America, John Sadler was muzzled by the
responsibilities of office, and Hugh Peters was without
an influential following. Moreover, the prosecutions of
James Naylor and Biddle were then prominently before
the public as a lesson that Toleration had yet to triumph
within the Christian pale. The Conversionists and Millenarians,
who formed the great majority of the Judeophils,
and who included all Menasseh’s own friends except
Sadler, attached no importance to the terms on which the
Jews might be admitted, and were quite willing to acquiesce
in legislative restrictions provided only they were admitted.
The Economists and Political Opportunists, represented
by Cromwell, Thurloe, Blake, and Monk,<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c015'><sup>[74]</sup></a> did not dare to
confess their true motives, since their worldly aims would
on the one hand have been condemned by all the religious
partisans of the Readmission, and on the other, would
have alarmed the merchants of London, who had no desire
for the commercial competition of a privileged colony of
Hebrew traders.</p>

<p class='c007'>This discouraging state of affairs was aggravated by
foreign and Royalist intrigues. From the moment Menasseh’s
mission was thought of, the Embassies in London and
the Royalist agents set to work to defeat it. The Embassies,
especially that of Holland, opposed it on its true grounds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xli'>xli</span>as a development of the policy of the Navigation Act.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c015'><sup>[75]</sup></a>
The Royalists were anxious to defeat it because, as Whitelock
says, “it was a business of much importance to the
Commonwealth, and the Protector was earnestly set upon
it.”<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c015'><sup>[76]</sup></a> Moreover, they had hoped to attract the Jews to
their own cause, and they had been encouraged in this
hope by the substantial assistance already rendered to them
by wealthy Hebrews, like the Da Costas and Coronels.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c015'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
An intercepted letter from Sir Edward Nicholas, Secretary
to the exiled King, shows that the highest Royalist circles
took a profound interest in the Jewish question, and made
it their business to be well informed as to its progress.
Nicholas, indeed, seems to have known all about the negotiations
which preceded Menasseh’s journey to England.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c015'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as Menasseh reached London, he found himself
the object of a host of calumnious legends, clearly
designed by the Royalists and foreign agents to disturb the
public mind. The story that the Jews had offered to buy
St. Paul’s Cathedral and the Bodleian Library, which had
been circulated unheeded in 1649, was revived.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c015'><sup>[79]</sup></a> One of
Menasseh’s retinue was accused of wishing to identify
Cromwell as the Jewish Messiah, and it was circumstantially
stated that he had investigated the Protector’s pedigree in
order to prove his Davidic descent.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c015'><sup>[80]</sup></a> It was declared that
Cromwell harboured a design to hand over to the Jews the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlii'>xlii</span>farming of the customs.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c015'><sup>[81]</sup></a> At the same time their character
was painted in the darkest colours.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c015'><sup>[82]</sup></a> One of the most insidious
forms that this campaign took was an attempt to show
that the hope of converting the Jews, by which the larger
number of the friends of the Readmission were actuated, was
illusory, and that so far from becoming Christians, the Jews
would “stone Christ to death.” For this purpose the pen
of a converted Jew, named Paul Isaiah, who had served as
a trooper in Rupert’s Horse, was requisitioned.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c015'><sup>[83]</sup></a> It was a
hazardous experiment to employ Isaiah, for he might easily
have been hailed by the Conversionists as a proof of the
convertibility of the Jews. It was, however, notorious that
he had learnt the ethics of the wilder Cavalier swashbucklers
only too well,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c015'><sup>[84]</sup></a> and he was consequently regarded rather
as an “awful example” of the sort of Jew who might be
expected to listen to the Gospel than as an encouragement
to hope for the salvation of the whole people.</p>

<p class='c007'>The publication of the “Humble Addresses” only
aggravated these popular misgivings. While the clerical
and commercial Anti-Semites disputed all the propositions
of Menasseh’s pamphlet, the visionaries and friends of
Israel strongly resented the “sinfulness” of its insistence
on the profitableness of the Jews. The bias of public
feeling, as revealed by the tracts to which the “Humble
Addresses” gave rise, was distinctly less favourable than
in 1649, and was overwhelmingly hostile to an unreserved
acquiescence in the terms of the Jewish petition.
In 1649 an honest attempt to understand Judaism was
made, as we may see by the publication of Chilmead’s
translation of Leo de Modena’s <em>Historia dei riti ebraici</em>.
There is no trace of an appeal to this or any similarly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xliii'>xliii</span>authoritative work in 1655–56, except in a stray passage
of an isolated protest against the calumnies heaped on the
Jews.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c015'><sup>[85]</sup></a> On the contrary, the efforts of the new students
of Judaism, like Alexander Ross, were devoted to proving
that the Jews had nothing in common with Christians,
and that their religion “is not founded on Moses and the
Law, but on idle and foolish traditions of the Rabbins”—that
it was, in fact, a sort of Paganism.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c015'><sup>[86]</sup></a> The historical
attacks on the Jews were the most powerful that had yet
been made, while the replies to them were few and by
obscure writers.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c015'><sup>[87]</sup></a> What is most significant, however, is that
the chief friends of the Jews—the men who had encouraged
Menasseh six years before—were now either silent or openly
in favour of restrictions which would have rendered the
Readmission a barren privilege. Sadler did not reiterate
the Judeophil teachings of his “Rights of the Kingdom”;
there was no echo of Hugh Peters’s “Good Work for a
Good Magistrate,” with its uncompromising demand for
liberty of conscience; and the pseudonymous author of
“An Apology for the Honourable Nation of Jews,” which
had so strongly impressed the public in 1648, was dumb.
John Dury, who had practically started the first agitation
in favour of the Jews, was now studying Jewish disabilities
at Cassel, with a view to their introduction into England;<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c015'><sup>[88]</sup></a>
and Henry Jessey, the author of “The Glory of Judah and
Israel,” to the testimonies of which Menasseh confidently
appealed in the closing paragraph of his “Humble Addresses,”
had been won over to the necessity of restrictions.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c015'><sup>[89]</sup></a>
Not a single influential voice was raised in England in
support of Menasseh’s proposals, either on the ground of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xliv'>xliv</span>love for the Jews or religious liberty. The temper of the
unlettered people, especially the mercantile classes, is sufficiently
illustrated by the fact that only a few months before
a Jewish beggar had been mobbed in the city, owing to
the inflammatory conduct of a merchant, who had followed
the poor stranger about the Poultry shouting, “Give him
nothing; he is a cursed Jew.”<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c015'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Undeterred by the inhospitable attitude of the public,
Menasseh formally opened his negotiations with the Government
of the Commonwealth. His first step was to pay a
visit to Whitehall, and present copies of his “Humble
Addresses” to the Council of State. He was unfortunate
in the day he selected for this visit, for it happened to be
one of the rare occasions when Cromwell was not present at
the Council’s deliberations. The result was that, as on
the similar occasion of the consideration of the report on
Dormido’s petition, the Council felt itself free to take no
action. It contented itself with instructing its clerk, Mr.
Jessop, “to go forth and receive the said books,” and then
proceeded with other business.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c015'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>That the Council had no desire to assume the responsibility
of deciding the thorny Jewish question soon became
manifest. A fortnight after Menasseh’s abortive visit to
Whitehall, Cromwell brought down to the Council a petition
which had been handed to him by the Jewish Rabbi,
in which were set forth categorically the several “graces
and favours” by which it was proposed that the Readmission
of the Jews should be effected.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c015'><sup>[92]</sup></a> The Protector evidently
felt none of the misgivings of his advisers. It is
probable, indeed, that in his masterful way he misunderstood
the trend of public feeling. He had convinced himself
that, as an act of policy, some concession to the Jews
was desirable. His strong instinct for religious liberty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlv'>xlv</span>inclined him favourably to the more academic aspects of
the question, and his profound sympathy with persecuted
peoples had been stirred by the accounts Menasseh had
personally given him of the dire straits of the Jews in
Poland, Sweden, and the Holy Land, and of the cruelties
inflicted on them in Spain and Portugal.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c015'><sup>[93]</sup></a> Moreover, his
patriotism revolted at the idea that Protestant England
should be <em>particeps criminis</em> in a policy of oppression which
was so peculiarly identified with Papistical error. Thus
impressed, he cared little for the outcries of the pamphleteers
or the nervous scruples of his councillors, and he set himself
to force on a prompt solution. At his instance a
motion was made “That the Jews deserving it may be
admitted into this nation to trade and traffic and dwell
amongst us as Providence shall give occasion,”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c015'><sup>[94]</sup></a> and this,
together with the petition of Menasseh and his “Humble
Addresses,” was at once referred to a Committee. At the
same time it was made clear to that body that the Protector
expected an early report.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c015'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>So much is evident from the fact that the Committee
met the same afternoon and reported the next morning.
Its task was not an easy one. The feeling of the Council
was by no means hostile to the Jews, but it had no
enthusiasm for their cause, and it probably felt that an extension
of official toleration beyond the limits of Christianity
was a hazardous experiment. On the other hand,
it was no longer possible for it to express this feeling in
the same unceremonious fashion as had been done in the
case of Dormido. The Jewish question had become the
question of the day owing to Menasseh’s visit. Public
feeling had been deeply stirred by it, and Cromwell had
placed it in the forefront of his personal solicitude. Some
action was necessary. The Committee seems to have discreetly
resolved that the wisest course to pursue was one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlvi'>xlvi</span>which would absolve it of responsibility, and leave Cromwell
and the outside public to fight it out between them. Accordingly
it reported that it felt itself incompetent to offer
any advice to the Council, and it suggested that the views
of the nation should be ascertained by the summoning of a
Conference of representative Englishmen who might assist
it in framing a report.</p>

<p class='c007'>This resolution was duly reported to the Council on
the following day, when Cromwell was again present. How
little the Protector estimated the difficulties in his path is
shown by the fact that the Committee’s recommendation
was at once acted upon. John Lisle, Sir Charles Wolseley,
and Sir Gilbert Pickering, three members of the Committee
notoriously devoted to Cromwell, were instructed
to meet the Lord President the same afternoon, and draw
up a list of the personages to be summoned to the proposed
Conference.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c015'><sup>[96]</sup></a> The list was duly presented to the Council
on the following morning, and, under the vigilant eye of
the Protector, approved. At the same time the terms of a
circular convening the Conference were agreed upon, and
the 4th December was fixed for the meeting.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c015'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing is more significant than the rapidity with which
these steps were taken. On Tuesday the 13th November
Menasseh’s petition was sprung on the reluctant Council.
On the following Thursday summonses to a National Conference
were being sent out from Whitehall, the Council having
meanwhile held three meetings, at all of which the Jewish
question was discussed, and a Committee specially charged
with the question having held two further meetings. In all this
we may clearly trace the personal insistence of the Protector.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bruited abroad through the congregations of the divines
and the constituents of the politicians and merchants to
whom the summonses to the Conference had been addressed,
the question of the Readmission of the Jews now came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlvii'>xlvii</span>the forefront of national politics. Amid considerable
popular excitement, the Conference met in the Council
Chamber at Whitehall<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c015'><sup>[98]</sup></a> on the first Tuesday in December.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a notable gathering—one of the most notable in
the whole history of the Commonwealth. The statesmen
present were the most eminent on the active list of the
moment. There was Henry Lawrence, the Lord President,
with four of his civilian colleagues on the Council, Sir
Gilbert Pickering, Sir Charles Wolseley, Lisle the regicide,
and Francis Rous. Close by was Walter Strickland, the
diplomatist, who had represented the Commonwealth at
the Hague, and had shared with Oliver St. John the
honours and mortifications of the famous mission of 1651.
In the same inner circle were John Lambert, “the army’s
darling,” and one of the most brilliant of Cromwell’s
veterans, and William Sydenham, one of the founders of
the Protectorate. The law was represented by Sir John
Glynne, Chief Justice of the Upper Bench, and William
Steele, Chief Baron of the Exchequer. Lord Chief Justice
St. John had also been invited, but he astutely stayed away.
Those who knew St. John must have regarded his absence
as ominous. On behalf of the mercantile community there
appeared Alderman Dethick, the Lord Mayor of London,
Alderman Cressett of the Charterhouse, Alderman Riccards,
and Sheriff Thompson. These men were official nonentities,
for the real representatives of Commerce were Sir
Christopher Pack, the late Lord Mayor and the leading
mercantile authority in the country, William Kiffen, the
wealthy merchant-parson, and the regicide Owen Rowe,
now deputy-governor of the Bermuda Company.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was, however, on the religious side that the Conference
was strongest. Sixteen theologians and divines, the flower
of Puritan piety and learning, responded to Cromwell’s
invitation. There was Dr. Cudworth, Regius Professor
of Hebrew, the philosophic opponent of atheism, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlviii'>xlviii</span>“Intellectual System” is an English classic. There, too,
were Dr. Owen, most famous of Independent divines and
most fearless of the champions of religious liberty, and
John Caryll, the great Puritan Bible commentator. Oxford
University sent Dr. Goodwin, President of Magdalen
College, and Henry Wilkinson, Canon of Christ Church.
Cambridge appeared in the person of the learned Dr.
Whitchcote, Provost of King’s. Among the preachers
were William Bridge of Yarmouth; Daniel Dyke, one of
Cromwell’s chaplains in ordinary; Henry Jessey, the Baptist
Judeophil and friend of Menasseh; Thomas Manton,
mildest and most genial of Presbyterians, “the prelate of
the Commonwealth,” as Wood calls him; Dr. Newcomen,
one of the authors of “Smectymnuus”; Philip Nye, the
sturdy Independent and champion of toleration; Anthony
Tuckney, one of the most prominent divines of the Westminster
Assembly, and three lesser lights, William Benn of
Dorchester, Walter Craddock of All Hallows the Great,
London, and Samuel Fairclough. John Carter, the vehement
enemy of Presbyterianism and monarchy, could not attend,
for he was on his deathbed at Norwich when the invitation
reached him.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c015'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is not difficult to see that the Conference had been
carefully organised with a view to a decision favourable to
the Jews. The great majority of the members were conspicuous
for their attachment to the cause of religious
toleration, while not a few of the laymen were equally
notorious for their devotion—some for their subservience—to
Cromwell. And yet its upshot proved very different
from what the Protector anticipated.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c015'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The first meeting was chiefly concerned with the legal
problem. After the proposals of Menasseh ben Israel had
been read, Cromwell himself laid down the programme of
the proceedings in two questions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xlix'>xlix</span>(1) Whether it be lawful to receive the Jews?</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) If it be lawful, then upon what terms is it meet to
receive them?<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c015'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The first question was purely technical, and only the
lawyers were competent to pronounce an opinion on it.
Accordingly, the two Judges present, Glynne and Steele,
were called upon to speak. After an elaborate review of
the status of the Jews in the pre-expulsion period, and
the circumstances under which they were banished in 1290,
both expressed the opinion that “there was no law which
forbad the Jews’ return into England.”<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c015'><sup>[102]</sup></a> The grounds of
this decision are nowhere stated. It was probably based
on the fact that the banishment in 1290 was an exercise of
the royal prerogative in regard to the personal “chattels”
of the King and not an Act of Parliament, and that the
force of the decree expired with the death of Edward I.
At any rate, Cromwell had gained his first point,<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c015'><sup>[103]</sup></a> and he
joyfully adjourned the Conference to the following Friday,
adjuring the divines meanwhile to ponder well the second
question.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c015'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>What happened at the two following meetings, which
were held on the 7th and 12th December,<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c015'><sup>[105]</sup></a> we do not know
in detail. The records of the time only afford us scanty
glimpses of the opinions expressed, without any indication
of the days on which they were respectively uttered. It is
clear, however, that the feeling of the clergy turned out to
be on the whole unfavourable to Menasseh’s petition. The
calumnies of the pamphleteers had done their work. The
idea of public religious services at which Christ might be
blasphemed stayed the hands of the most tolerant. Others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_l'>l</span>feared that unrestricted liberty of Jewish worship would
create in the Synagogue a nucleus round which the Judaical
sectaries would rally. Dr. Newcomen drew a harrowing
picture of English converts to Judaism joining the immigrants
in offering children to Moloch.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c015'><sup>[106]</sup></a> The moderate
majority, impressed, probably, by a weighty and elaborate
opinion drawn up by Dr. Barlow, librarian of the Bodleian,
and presented to the Conference by Dr. Goodwin,<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c015'><sup>[107]</sup></a> were
strongly in favour of an admission under severe restrictions.
Even the level-headed Nye, who was ready to tolerate all
religious follies so long as they were peaceable, asked for
“due cautions warranted by Holy Scripture.”<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c015'><sup>[108]</sup></a> It was in
vain that Lawrence and Lambert, supported by the learned
commentator Caryll, combated these opinions.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c015'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On the eve of the third meeting Cromwell sought to
strengthen the Judeophils by adding to the Conference
Hugh Peters, the oldest of the advocates of unrestricted
Readmission, together with his favourite chaplain, Peter
Sterry, and Mr. Bulkeley, the Provost of Eton.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c015'><sup>[110]</sup></a> This,
however, did not improve matters, for Peters had meanwhile
heard something of the Marranos in London and
their papistical dissimulation of their religion, and he
vigorously denounced the Jews as “a self-seeking generation”
who “made but little conscience of their own
principles.”<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c015'><sup>[111]</sup></a> This discourse seems to have produced a considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_li'>li</span>impression on the Conference, for Thurloe,
writing to Henry Cromwell on the 17th, expressed the
shrewd opinion that “nothing will be done.”<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c015'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>So far, however, the essential point for which Cromwell
had been striving had not been jeopardised. He was desirous
of securing the admission of the Jews on liberal terms,
but at a pinch he would no doubt have agreed to religious
and civil restrictions, provided the commercial activity of
the immigrants was not unduly fettered. Hence the terms
favoured by the majority of the clergy did not trouble him
very seriously.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the final meeting, which was held on the 18th
December,<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c015'><sup>[113]</sup></a> the commercial question was broached. On
this occasion the doors of the Council Chamber were, for some
sinister reason, thrown open to the public,<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c015'><sup>[114]</sup></a> and an excited
crowd, armed with copies of Prynne’s newly published tract
on the Jewish question,<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c015'><sup>[115]</sup></a> collected to hear the debate. The
proceedings were tempestuous from the beginning, and
gradually they took the form of a vehement demonstration
against the Jews. Merchant after merchant rose and
violently protested against any concessions, declaring that
the Hebrews were a mean and vicious people, and that
their admission would enrich foreigners and impoverish the
natives.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c015'><sup>[116]</sup></a> Even strangers took part in these tirades, and a
Mr. Lloyd, who was not a member of the Conference,
distinguished himself by a “fierce” harangue.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c015'><sup>[117]</sup></a> The climax
was reached when Sir Christopher Pack, the most eminent
citizen of his day, and a devoted adherent of the Protector,
ranged himself with the opponents of Menasseh, in an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lii'>lii</span>address which is said to have been the most impressive
delivered during the whole course of the Conference.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c015'><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The advocates of out-and-out exclusion were, however,
as little likely to carry the day as the champions of unrestricted
admission, for the majority of the members of the
Conference were divines who were anxious that the Jews
should be converted, and for that reason desired that they
should be somehow or other brought into the country.
Moreover, since the decision of the Judges, the question was
no longer whether exclusion should be persisted in, but
only on what terms admission should be sanctioned. This
was probably pointed out to the merchants, and an attempt
to arrive at a compromise was made. After some private
confabulations, Henry Jessey rose to announce the terms
that had been agreed upon. The appearance of Jessey, the
profound Rabbinical student, the friend of Menasseh, and
one of the veterans of the Readmission cause, seemed to
betoken a Jewish victory. What must have been the
astonishment of his friends when he stated, with naïve
satisfaction, that the basis of the compromise was that the
Jews should only be admitted to decayed ports and towns,
and that they should pay double customs duties on their
imports and exports!<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c015'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Cromwell now saw his whole scheme crumbling to
pieces. That, if put to the vote, Jessey’s compromise
would be adopted by an overwhelming majority was patent
to everybody. In that case not only would the commercial
design which Cromwell had at heart be defeated, but the
Marranos in London, who had served him so well, would be
practically banished. At all hazards a vote had to be prevented.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c015'><sup>[120]</sup></a>
Cromwell acted with characteristic promptness
and audacity. Rising from the chair of state, he addressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_liii'>liii</span>the Assembly. Ingeniously ignoring the proposed compromise,
he began his speech with a review of the differences
of opinion revealed by the various speakers. They were, he
scornfully declared, a babel of discordances. He had hoped
that the Preachers would have given him some clear and
practical advice, but they had only multiplied his doubts.
Protesting that he had no engagements to the Jews but
what the Scriptures held forth, he insisted that “since there
was a promise of their conversion, means must be used to
that end, which was the preaching of the Gospel, and that
could not be done unless they were permitted to dwell
where the Gospel was preached.” Then, turning to the
merchants, he harped sarcastically on the accusations they had
brought against the Jews. “You say they are the meanest
and most despised of all people. So be it. But in that
case what becomes of your fears? Can you really be afraid
that this contemptible and despised people should be able
to prevail in trade and credit over the merchants of England,
the noblest and most esteemed merchants of the whole
world?” It was clear, he added sharply, that no help was
to be expected from the Conference, and that he and the
Council would have to take their own course. He hoped
he should do nothing foolishly or rashly, and he asked now
only that the Conference would give him the benefit of
their prayers, so that he might be directed to act for the
glory of God and the good of the nation.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c015'><sup>[121]</sup></a> So saying, he
vacated the chair in token that the proceedings were at
an end.</p>

<p class='c007'>The speech was a fighting speech, delivered with great
animation, and is said to have been one of the best Cromwell
ever made.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c015'><sup>[122]</sup></a> It achieved its object, for the Conference
broke up without a word of protest, and the crowds dispersed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_liv'>liv</span>in cowed silence. Cromwell left the Council Chamber
in a towering passion, and it was some days before he
recovered his equanimity.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c015'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The battle was, however, not yet over. Cromwell had
dismissed the Conference, but the Committee of the
Council of State had yet to report. It could not well, in
sober writing, take the view of the Protector’s strategic
speech, nor could it ignore the instruction of the Council
to which it owed its existence. Accordingly it set itself to
the drafting of a report which should express the obvious
views of the Conference without conflicting too violently
with Cromwell’s equally obvious design. The report
accepted the view of the Judges that there was no law
against the Readmission, and then proceeded to set forth
under six heads the views urged by the Conference, including
the view of the merchants, that “great prejudice is likely
to arise to the natives of this Commonwealth in matters of
trade.” Finally, it laid down seven conditions, apparently
borrowed from Barlow’s opinion,<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c015'><sup>[124]</sup></a> by which the Readmission
should be governed. The Jews should have no
autonomous jurisdiction; they should be forbidden from
blaspheming Christ; they should not profane the Christian
Sabbath; they should have no Christian servants; they
should be ineligible for public office; they should print
nothing against Christianity, and they should not discourage
those who might attempt to convert them, while the
making of converts by them should be prohibited. No
restriction on their trading was suggested.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c015'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>What became of this document is not clear. A clean
copy of it, undated and unendorsed, is preserved in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lv'>lv</span>State Papers, but there is no reference to it in the Order
Book of the Council of State.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c015'><sup>[126]</sup></a> And yet it is certain that the
Committee presented it to the Council, for the Conference
was only a means of enlightening the Committee, and the
Council still looked to it for advice. It is probable that
it was never formally accepted by the Council. When
it was in due course brought up, Cromwell most likely
objected to its presentation. After his experience of the
Conference, it was clear to him that whatever was done
would have to be done more or less unofficially. The
acceptance of the report would have involved legislation, in
which case the proceedings of the Conference would have
been repeated in a form far more difficult to control, and
perhaps impossible to defeat. Gratified by the omission
of trade restrictions from the report, and feeling the necessity
of retaining the support of the Council in the further
steps he might take, the Protector probably assured them
that he was in agreement with them on most points, and
that he would do nothing unwarranted by the views they
had expressed. At the same time he doubtless pointed
out that many other important questions claimed the
attention of Parliament, and that it would be well if men’s
minds were not further disturbed by the Jewish question.
Accordingly he advised that the report should be ignored
and the matter allowed to drop.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c015'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Here the question rested at the end of 1655. The
result was not encouraging, but at any rate one important
point had been gained. The prevailing idea that the incoming
of Jews and their sojourn in the land were illegal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lvi'>lvi</span>had been completely and finally shattered. This was the
thin end of the wedge, and it had been so securely driven
in, that John Evelyn entered in his Diary under date of
December 14th: “Now were the Jews admitted.”<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c015'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>V. Cromwell’s Action</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>Had the Diarist waited until the close of the Whitehall
Conferences he would probably have modified his opinion.
Although the technical question of the right of incoming
had been decided, the cause of the Readmission had not
been materially advanced. The universal demand for restrictions
rendered it impossible for the Jews to avail themselves
of their legal right without an assurance of protection
from the Government. As late as the following April no
complete settlement on this point had been reached, for in
the passage from the <em>Vindiciæ</em> already quoted, Menasseh
wrote on the 10th of that month, “As yet we have had
no finall determination from his most Serene Highnesse.”<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c015'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>What happened after the Conferences is somewhat
obscure, owing to the reticence of the public records on
the Jewish question. It is certain, however, that before
Cromwell’s death a favourable decision was arrived at,
and that an organised Jewish community came into the
light of day in London, protected by definite rights of
residence, worship, and trade. This is proved by the
petitions for the re-expulsion of the Jews presented to
Charles II. on his arrival in London in 1660, and especially
by a statement in a petition of the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen of the City of London, that “in that grand
Complicacon of mischeifs brought on yo<sup>r</sup> Ma<sup>ties</sup> good
subjects by y<sup>e</sup> corrupt interest of the late usurper <em>y<sup>e</sup> admission
of Jews to a free cohabition and trade in these dominions</em>
was found to be a most heavy pressure on yo<sup>r</sup> Peticon<sup>rs.</sup>”<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c015'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_lvii'>lvii</span>How had this free settlement been brought about? It
is not altogether impossible to reconstruct the story, although
the materials are scanty and vague.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cromwell’s parting speech to the Whitehall Assembly,
and the continued residence of Menasseh in London, must
have excited apprehension among the extreme Judeophobes.
The decision of the Judges and the Protector’s threat that
he and the Council would take their own course rendered a
formal proclamation of Readmission by no means improbable.
On the other hand, the great bulk of the nation had
shown itself unfavourable to the scheme, and there was
just a chance that this might stay Cromwell’s hand. This
popular ill-feeling the anti-Semitic pamphleteers now set
themselves to inflame. It was probably hoped by this
means, if not to intimidate the Protector, at any rate to
strengthen the Council in their resistance to his original
programme.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new year had scarcely dawned when the indefatigable
pen of Prynne was again at work on an enlarged
edition of his “Demurrer.” In this work he especially
devoted himself to the legal question, amplifying by some
twenty pages his argument that the expulsion by Edward I.
remained valid, and could only be reversed by an Act of
Parliament. In February he published Part II. of the
“Demurrer,” containing a further instalment of documents
relating to the history of the Jews in England in the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries. The object of this work, which is
a monument of research, and which until a generation ago
was the chief printed source of our knowledge of the
mediæval history of the English Jews, was to show that
the Jews had never lived in England except under severe
disabilities, and that they were a people of phenomenal
viciousness, clippers of coin, crucifiers of children, and
the blaspheming devotees of a ghastly blood cultus. Less
learned, but not less virulent, was Alexander Ross, whose
calumnious “View of the Jewish Religion” was published
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lviii'>lviii</span>about the same time. Several anonymous pamphleteers
followed suit. The campaign does not seem to have excited
much agitation, but it probably had the effect of
deciding Cromwell not to attempt a public solution of
the question in the sense of his own private wishes and
of Menasseh’s petition.</p>

<p class='c007'>All that was urgent he had, indeed, already done.
Shortly after the termination of the Whitehall Conferences
he had verbally assured the London Marranos of his personal
protection, and had given them permission to celebrate
divine worship after the Jewish fashion, on condition
that the services were held in private houses.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c015'><sup>[131]</sup></a> These
favours were conveyed through John Sadler, no doubt in
order to avoid any further apprehensions of a reopening of
the Jewish question that might be aroused by granting an
audience to Menasseh. The restriction in regard to the
privacy of the services shows that Cromwell had definitely
resolved to adhere to his compromise with the Council and
to respect the spirit of their report. Legally the Jews were
entitled to celebrate divine worship in public, for, by the
repeal of the Recusancy Acts by the Long Parliament in
1650, the practice of every kind of religious duty, “either
of prayer, preaching, reading or expounding the Scriptures,”
had been legalised, the celebration of mass being alone excepted.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c015'><sup>[132]</sup></a>
It would, however, have been dangerous for the
Jews to claim this right, and Cromwell no doubt pointed
out to them that, in that case, it would be necessary to
apply to Parliament for legislation, which could only have
taken the form of enacting the oppressive recommendations
of the Whitehall Conferences. Under these circumstances
the Marranos could not but acquiesce. That their desire
for synagogue services was entirely due to their Jewish
piety, or was animated by a craving for martyrdom, is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lix'>lix</span>moreover, very unlikely. The outbreak of war with Spain
had rendered it impossible for them to continue, in their
guise of <em>Nuevos Cristianos</em>, to attend the services in the
Spanish Ambassador’s chapel, and as they were bound by
the Act of 1650 to resort to some place “where the service
or worship of God is exercised,” they were confronted by
the necessity of either posing as pseudo-Protestants or
frankly practising Judaism. The former course was out of
the question, especially after Hugh Peters’s condemnation
of their hypocrisy at Whitehall. Hence their request to
be permitted to worship as Jews. By Cromwell’s acquiescence
in this request and his promise of protection
a secret beginning in the way of Readmission had been
informally accomplished.</p>

<p class='c007'>This arrangement was, however, not destined to endure.
It was an evasion of the will of the Whitehall Conferences—an
attempt, as Graetz has well said, to readmit the Jews
“nicht durch das grosse Portal sondern durch eine Hinterthür.”<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c015'><sup>[133]</sup></a>
It was condemned to failure, too, because its
secret could not be kept. Even before the end of 1655
Cromwell’s intentions were known. In a scrap of a
Royalist letter of intelligence, dated December 31, and
preserved in the State Papers, the writer says, “The Jews,
we hear, will be admitted by way of connivancy, though
the generality oppose.”<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c015'><sup>[134]</sup></a> The secret arrangement with
regard to divine worship was also soon bruited abroad. In
a despatch dated January 28, 1656, Salvetti, the diplomatic
agent of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, informed his master
that “the affair of the Jews continues in the state I have
already described; meanwhile they may meet privately in
their houses, but they have not yet established a synagogue.”<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c015'><sup>[135]</sup></a>
In a later despatch (February 4) he confirms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lx'>lx</span>this information and amplifies it. “It is thought,” he
writes, “that the Protector will not make any declaration in
their favour, but tacitly he will connive at their holding
private conventicles, which they already do, in their houses
in order to avoid public scandal.”<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c015'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>From the Royalist spies and the diplomatists the news
was quickly conveyed to the anti-Semites in the City.
Although the dangers of a Jewish immigration <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></i>
and the scandal of a public synagogue had been averted,
the enemies of the Jews—especially their competitors in
trade—were not inclined to acquiesce without a struggle in
the tacit toleration of even a small community of Hebrew
merchants. But what could be done? As Jews the position
of the intruders was legal, and any attempt to persecute
them in that capacity would probably be resented in a
disagreeable fashion by the masterful Protector. Moreover,
as the most serious evils of the Jewish problem had been
provided against, and the public mind was preoccupied
with the war with Spain, it might be difficult to enlist
a large measure of support in an agitation against the
strangers. An opportunity for showing their teeth soon
presented itself to the City merchants, and they were not
slow to avail themselves of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in March 1656 a proclamation was issued by the
Privy Council declaring all Spanish monies, merchandise,
and shipping to be lawful prize. The ink of this document
was scarcely dry—indeed it had not been formally
published—when, on the denunciation of an informer, the
house of Don Antonio Rodrigues Robles, a wealthy
Spanish merchant and Marrano of Duke’s Place, City, was
entered by bailiffs armed with a Privy Council warrant
instructing them to “seize, secure, and keep under safe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxi'>lxi</span>custody all the goods and papers therein found.” On the
same day the Commissioners of Customs, acting under a
similar warrant, took possession of two ships in the Thames,
the <em>Two Brothers</em> and the <em>Tobias</em>, which were believed
to be Robles’s property.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c015'><sup>[137]</sup></a> On the face of it, this action
seemed to have no connection with the Jewish question.
The fact that the information on which the warrants were
based was presented to the Council by so staunch a friend
of the Jews as Thurloe suffices to show that its Jewish
bearing was at first quite unsuspected. It was apparently
the private enterprise of a perfidious scrivener named
Francis Knevett, who, after obtaining the confidence of
several members of the Marrano community in his professional
capacity, had discovered that under the new proclamation
he might betray them with advantage to himself.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c015'><sup>[138]</sup></a>
This seems also to have been the view of Robles, for in
a petition he immediately addressed to the Protector he
disputed the validity of the seizures on the purely legal
ground that he was a Portuguese and not a Spaniard, and
that his rights as a Merchant Stranger, which were consequently
unaffected by the war with Spain, had been
unjustly invaded.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c015'><sup>[139]</sup></a> On this point the Council, to whom the
petition was referred, ordered an inquiry, and one of its
members, Colonel Jones, was deputed to take evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile some suspicion that the case was aimed at the
newly acquired privileges of the Marranos seems to have got
abroad. Many of the Jews in London were of Spanish
birth, and others, though natives of Portugal, were probably
endenizened Spaniards, since in their guise of <em>Nuevos
Cristianos</em> they had held high office under the King of Spain.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c015'><sup>[140]</sup></a>
It was clear, then, that if the case against Robles was established
other prosecutions would follow, and in that way the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxii'>lxii</span>small Jewish community would be broken up. The danger
was all the greater since the protection and privileges so recently
acquired by the Jews had only been granted verbally,
and might easily be repudiated if public opinion proved too
strong for the Protector. There was, however, no immediate
reason why the leading Marranos, who had hitherto
been in negotiation with Cromwell, should take up Robles’s
cudgels, for he belonged to a party in the Synagogue which
had imbibed strong Royalist sympathies in Holland and
France, and which, consequently, had kept itself aloof from
Menasseh’s Readmission campaign. They accordingly confined
themselves to the presentation of a petition to the
Protector, in which they asked that the “favours and protection”
accorded to them, including the right of worship,
might be confirmed in writing. At the same time they
prayed for a license to acquire ground for a Jewish cemetery.
This document was signed by Menasseh ben Israel, Antonio
Fernandez Carvajal, and five other Marranos, but Robles
was not among its<a id='txlii'></a> signatories.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c015'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Cromwell at once referred this petition to the Council,
but the Lord President, apparently recognising that the
Jewish question was coming up in a new form, held it
back until the Robles case had been dealt with.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c015'><sup>[142]</sup></a> The
fact that Robles was a Jew had, indeed, already been
ascertained, and the belief that the prosecution was
aimed at all his co-religionists was gaining ground owing
to a new outburst of activity on the part of the anti-Semites.
The anxiety of the Marranos at the shelving
of their petition became accentuated by this agitation,
and especially by the doubts which it seemed to be producing
in the minds of some of their best friends. The
wavering feeling in high places was made disagreeably
manifest to them by a letter addressed to Menasseh ben
Israel by John Sadler, in which that friend of the Jews
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxiii'>lxiii</span>pointed out that the charges of ritual murder and <em>quasi</em>
idolatry preferred by Prynne and Ross were being widely
discussed, and that a public answer to them was urgently
necessary.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c015'><sup>[143]</sup></a> Before Menasseh’s reply was written Colonel
Jones presented an interim report to the Council, from
which it appeared <em>inter alia</em> that Knevett had filed a further
information denouncing other Marranos as Spanish subjects.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c015'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It was now no longer possible to ignore the existence of
an anti-Jewish conspiracy. The first action of the Jews was
to hurry forward the publication of Menasseh’s reply to
Prynne and Ross. This took the form of the famous
<em>Vindiciæ Judæorum</em>—the third tract printed in the present
volume. It was described merely as “A Letter in Answer
to certain Questions propounded by a Noble and Learned
Gentleman touching the reproaches cast on the Nation of
the Jewes.” The date of its appearance, however, fixes its
relation to the Robles crisis, for it was published ten days
after Colonel Jones’s report, while the seriousness of that
crisis is strikingly illustrated by the urgent and earnest tone
of the pamphlet. Menasseh evidently felt that not only
his own grandiose idea of a new asylum for Israel was at
stake, but that even the small progress that had been
achieved towards that end was threatened by a more rigid
exclusion of the Hebrew nation. He threw his whole
soul into this fresh vindication of his people and their
claims. Nothing, indeed, that had come from his facile
pen had been more dignified, more impressive, more convincing.
The vanity, the superficiality, the pretentious
mysticism of his former works had gone. He was no
longer playing a part even to himself. He was merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxiv'>lxiv</span>the champion of his people in a moment of their sore
trial, writing from a heart whose every throb was for
their welfare and their honour. The simple eloquence of
this essay, its naïve garrulousness, the glimpses it yields of
a pious, gentle, self-denying character, made it one of the
most effective vindications of the Jews ever written. The
best tribute to its value is afforded by the fact that it has
since been frequently reprinted in all parts of Europe when
the calumnies it denounced have been revived.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Vindiciæ Judæorum</em> was a fitting prelude to the
dénouement that followed. With this certificate in their
hands the Marranos felt that they might risk claiming their
legal rights as Jews, and thus at once repudiate their Spanish
nationality and challenge a settlement of their status in the
country. The decision was a bold one, but there was shrewd
method in its apparent rashness. If the Marranos were
technically Spanish subjects, they were in reality testimonies
to the intolerance of Spain which made that country, in
Cromwell’s words, “the natural, the providential enemy of
England,”<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c015'><sup>[145]</sup></a> and which was one of the grounds of the war.
Like the Protestant traders whose liberty of conscience had
been trampled on in Spain they also had been persecuted,
though in a worse form. They were fugitives from the
Inquisition, and consequently had a peculiar claim on the
indulgence and consistency of the English people, who at
that moment were filled with righteous horror at the religious
policy of the “Popish enemy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In pursuance of this idea Robles now addressed a fresh
petition to the Protector, which reached the Council of State
on the 15th April,<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c015'><sup>[146]</sup></a> five days after the publication of the
<em>Vindiciæ</em>. In this document the purely legal question of
nationality was dropped, and Robles confined himself to
reciting how he and his kindred had been persecuted by the
Inquisition in Portugal and Spain, how his father had died
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxv'>lxv</span>under torture, how his mother had been crippled for life,
and other members of his family burnt or sent to the galleys
because they were Jews. He related that he had sought
refuge in England, “intending therein to shelter himselfe
from those tiranicall Proceedings and injoy those Beneffitts
and Kindnesse which this Com̄onw<sup>th</sup> ever aforded to aflicted
strangers.” He appealed to Cromwell’s notorious sympathy
for “afflicted ones,” and especially “owr nation the
Jews,” and skilfully suggested that a continuance of his
prosecution would be tantamount to the introduction of the
Inquisition into England. A week later affidavits confirming
the statements in this petition were signed by all the
leading Marranos and handed to Colonel Jones.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c015'><sup>[147]</sup></a> Thus the
Crypto-Jews threw off their disguise. In the investigations
which followed, the existence of over twenty Jewish
families in London was revealed, and it was given in
evidence that many of them had resided for years in the
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>These tactics produced dismay in the ranks of the anti-Semites.
Knevett made a last despairing effort to construct
a fresh case against the Jews by trying to bribe
Robles’s servants to assist him in framing a new information.
In this he failed.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c015'><sup>[148]</sup></a> The case was now quickly disposed
of. On April 25th the Council of State, still anxious
to avoid responsibility for a decision, sent all the papers to
the Admiralty Commissioners, with a request for a prompt
report. On May 11th the Commissioners summoned the
witnesses before them, but extracted little else from them
than that Robles was believed to be Portuguese, and that
they were all victims of the Inquisition. On May 14th the
Commissioners reported that they were unable to give a
definite opinion on the question of nationality. Two days
later the Council screwed up their courage to a decision,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxvi'>lxvi</span>and, without giving any reasons, ordered all the warrants to
be discharged, and reinstated Robles in the possession of his
goods, premises, and ships.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c015'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Jewish battle was won, and nothing now remained
but to secure the fruits of victory in an inexpugnable form.
What followed is, in detail, a matter of conjecture, but
the broad lines of the settlement we know from the
petition of the Corporation of the City of London, already
quoted. Rights of “cohabitation and trade in these
dominions” were formally accorded to the Jews in writing.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c015'><sup>[150]</sup></a>
That this happened before the end of 1656 we may
gather from a statement of Cromwell’s intimate friend,
Samuel Richardson, who, in his “Plain Dealing,” published
in that year, says of the Protector, “He hath
owned the poor despised people of God, and advanced many
of them to a better way and means of living.”<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c015'><sup>[151]</sup></a> The first
steps were probably taken on the 26th June, when the longdeferred
petition of the Marranos for a license to acquire a
burial-ground and for a confirmation in writing of their
rights of residence and worship came up for consideration.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c015'><sup>[152]</sup></a>
The Council, still reluctant to engage their responsibility,
made no entry of the discussion in their Order Book, and
it was probably arranged that Cromwell should personally
confirm the Jewish right of residence, subject to an understanding
that the spirit of the recommendations presented
to the Council after the Whitehall Conferences should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxvii'>lxvii</span>observed. The right to acquire a cemetery was certainly
granted. Cromwell probably further engaged himself to
instruct the London city authorities to place no impediments
in the way of the Jews trading on an equality with
other citizens.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c015'><sup>[153]</sup></a> On their side, the Marranos must have
agreed not to assist in an indiscriminate immigration of their
co-religionists, not to obtrude their worship and ceremonies
on the public, not to engage in religious controversy, and
not to make converts.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c015'><sup>[154]</sup></a> The restriction with regard to worshipping
in private houses was also probably revised, and
the maintenance of a synagogue, subject to the other conditions,
sanctioned.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c015'><sup>[155]</sup></a> In February 1657 Antonio de
Carvajal and another leading Marrano, Simon de Caceres,
signed the lease for a Jewish cemetery in Mile End.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c015'><sup>[156]</sup></a>
Shortly afterwards another result of the settlement was
made public. Solomon Dormido, a son of David Abarbanel
Dormido and nephew of Menasseh ben Israel, was
admitted to the Royal Exchange as a duly licensed broker
of the City of London, the authorities waiving in his
favour the Christological oath essential to the induction
of all brokers.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c015'><sup>[157]</sup></a> As wholesale trading in the City was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxviii'>lxviii</span>transacted exclusively through brokers, the admission of a
Jew to that limited fraternity is a substantial proof of the
acquisition of untrammelled trading rights by the new
community.</p>

<p class='c007'>The victory, it will be observed, secured to the local
Marranos all they required, and in a measure realised the
aims of Cromwell’s own policy. To Menasseh ben Israel,
however, it was no victory: it was a compromise of a
purely selfish nature, which left his idea of a proclamation
of a free asylum to the persecuted and scattered remnants
of Israel as remote as ever. We may be certain that he did
not hide his grief or his indignation. There is indeed
abundant reason for believing that he quarrelled over it
with the new Jewish community. His hopes of returning
to his old position in Amsterdam were shattered, for the
Dutch Jews, who had always shared the Stuart sympathies
of their Christian compatriots, had formally abandoned
him when they found they had nothing to gain from his
mission, and had opened negotiations on their own behalf
with the exiled king at Bruges.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c015'><sup>[158]</sup></a> He might, perhaps, have
secured his future by becoming Rabbi of the London community
had he been content to abide by the terms of the
new settlement. This, however, he sturdily refused, and
although he was deserted by all his friends, and his monetary
resources were exhausted, he continued from his lodging in
the Strand to urge on Cromwell the issue of the proclamation
on which he had set his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>That he must have quarrelled with the London Marranos
immediately after the settlement is shown by a letter
he addressed to Cromwell towards the end of 1656, in
which he asked for pecuniary help, and stated that he (the
Protector) was “the alone succourer of my life in this land
of strangers.”<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c015'><sup>[159]</sup></a> Cromwell responded with a gift of £25,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxix'>lxix</span>and in the following March granted him a pension of £100
a year, dating from February, and payable quarterly.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c015'><sup>[160]</sup></a> Unfortunately
this pension was never paid, and Menasseh became
overwhelmed with cares.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c015'><sup>[161]</sup></a> Nevertheless, for six months
longer he doggedly pursued his mission. In September
1657 his only surviving son, Samuel ben Israel, who had
remained with him in England, died.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c015'><sup>[162]</sup></a> Then his spirit
broke. Begging a few pounds from the Protector<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c015'><sup>[163]</sup></a> he
turned his steps homewards, carrying with him the corpse
of his son.</p>

<p class='c007'>A broken and beggared man he met his family at
Middelburg, in Zeeland. He was now bent with premature
age. The comely, good-tempered face, with its
quizzing eyes and dandyish moustache, so familiar to
us in Rembrandt’s etching, had become hollow-cheeked
and hollow-eyed. From the crow’s-feet under the temples
the whiskers had grown wildly until they formed a white
patriarchal beard.<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c015'><sup>[164]</sup></a> It was the wintering touch of the
hand of death. Two months later Menasseh died of a
broken heart at the house of his brother-in-law, Ephraim
Abarbanel, in the fifty-third year of his age.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c015'><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>VI. The Real “Vindiciæ”</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>One more question remains to be elucidated. How
did the seemingly precarious settlement of the London
Jews manage to survive the wreck of the Commonwealth?</p>

<p class='c007'>Both Menasseh and Cromwell had builded more solidly
than they knew. If the solution of the Jewish question
arrived at towards the end of 1656 was not wholly satisfactory,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxx'>lxx</span>it was precisely in that fact that its real strength
lay. Experimental compromise is the law of English
political progress. From the strife of wills represented
in its extremer forms by Cromwell’s lofty conception of
religious liberty on the one hand, and by the intolerance
of the sectaries on the other, had emerged a compromise
which conformed to this law, and which consequently made
the final solution of the question an integral part of English
political evolution. The great merit of the settlement was
that while it disturbed little, it gave the Jews a future in
the country on the condition that they were fitted to
possess it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact that in its initial stage it disturbed so little
rendered it easy for Charles II. to connive at it. Had
Menasseh ben Israel’s idea been realised in its entirety, the
task of the restored Monarchy would have been more difficult.
London would have been overrun by destitute Polish
and Bohemian Jews driven westward by persecution, some
fanaticised by their sufferings, others plying the parasitic
trades into which commercial and industrial disabilities
had driven the denizens of the Central European Jewries.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c015'><sup>[166]</sup></a>
Many of them would have become identified with the wild
Judaical sectaries who were the bitterest enemies of the
Stuarts, while the others would have given new life to
the tradition of Jewish usury, which for nearly four hundred
years had been only an historical reminiscence in the
country. Under these circumstances, we can well conceive
that a re-expulsion of the Jews might have been one of the
first tasks of the Restoration.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this calamity England and the Jews were saved
by the restricted character of the compromise of 1656.
When the Commonwealth fell to pieces the Jewish community
of London consisted only of some forty or fifty
families of wealthy and enterprising merchants, scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxi'>lxxi</span>distinguishable in their bearing and mode of life from the
best kinds of merchant-strangers hailing from Amsterdam,
Bordeaux, Lisbon, Cadiz, and Leghorn.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, efforts to procure their expulsion were
not wanting. Royalists who recognised in them a relic
of the hated Commonwealth, merchants whose restricted
economic science resented their activity and success, and
informers who imagined that their toleration was a violation
of English law, set to work early to denounce them.
These manœuvres began, indeed, as soon as the breath was
out of Cromwell’s body. Only a few weeks after the
Protector’s death a petition was presented to Richard
Cromwell demanding the expulsion of the Jews and the
confiscation of their property.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c015'><sup>[167]</sup></a> At the same time, Thomas
Violet, the notorious informer and pamphleteer, made a
collection of documents bearing on the illegality of the
Jewish settlement, which he submitted to Mr. Justice
Tyril, together with an application that the law should
be set in motion against the intrusive community. The
worthy Justice shrewdly suggested to Mr. Violet that in
the then confused political situation he would do well to
take no action. It would, he opined, be only prudent to
await the establishment of a stable Government before
moving in so serious a matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few months later Charles II. re-entered London, and
the Commonwealth was at an end. Naturally, everybody
looked to the new régime to redress the particular grievance
or grievances he harboured against “the late execrable
Usurper,” and the anti-Jewish party was particularly prompt
in its representations under this head. Scarcely had Charles
arrived in the Metropolis when the Lord Mayor and Aldermen
of the City of London presented to him a humble
petition, bitterly complaining of the action of Cromwell in
permitting the Jews to re-enter the land, and asking the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxii'>lxxii</span>King “to cause the former laws made against the Jews to
be put in execution, and to recommend to your two Houses
of Parliament to enact such new ones for the expulsion of
all professed Jews out of your Majesty’s dominions, and to
bar the door after them with such provisions and penalties,
as in your Majesty’s wisdom should be found most agreeable
to the benefits of religion, the honour of your Majesty,
and the good and welfare of your subjects.”<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c015'><sup>[168]</sup></a> The long
pent-up wrath of the City found full expression in this
petition, which must be read in its entirety to be appreciated.
Thomas Violet followed with another petition, which
was equally violent.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c015'><sup>[169]</sup></a> He declared that by law it was a
felony for any Jew to be found in England. He did not,
however, propose their expulsion, as he did not think that
would be the best way of turning them to profitable
account. His suggestion was in the first place that all
their estates and properties should be confiscated, and then
that they should be cast into prison and kept there until
ransomed by their wealthy brethren abroad. A third petition,
dated November 30, 1660, is preserved among the
Domestic State Papers, but the names of the authors are
not given. It runs very much on the lines of the City
petition, but it admits the hypothesis of Jews residing in
England under license, provided they were heavily taxed.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c015'><sup>[170]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>No direct reply to any of these petitions is recorded.
The views of the new Government are, however, no mystery.
In the first place, there was no real Jewish question in the
country, inasmuch as the Jews were very few, their character
was above reproach, and the practice of their religion was
conducted with so much tact and prudence that it was
impossible in sober truth to be moved by Violet’s impassioned
complaint of “a great dishonour of Christianity and
public scandal of the true Protestant religion.”<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c015'><sup>[171]</sup></a> Consequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxiii'>lxxiii</span>the Government were free to consider the question
exclusively from the point of view of secular politics.
Once regarded in this light the conclusion could not be
long in doubt. Cromwell’s maritime and commercial
policy had been adopted by the statesmen of the Restoration,
and the success of this policy—represented by the
re-enacted Navigation Act—depended to no inconsiderable
extent on toleration of the Jews.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, Charles was under personal obligations to the
Jews, and had assured them of his protection even before
he came by his own. The Jews of Amsterdam, and some
of the wealthier Jews in London, had assisted him during
his exile, especially the great family of Mendez da Costa
and Augustin Coronel, the agent for Portugal and a personal
friend of Monk.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c015'><sup>[172]</sup></a> Shortly after the mission of Menasseh
ben Israel to Cromwell these Jews had approached Charles II.
at Bruges and had assured him that they had neither assisted
nor approved the Rabbi’s negotiations. Thereupon General
Middleton had been instructed to treat with them for their
support to the Royalist cause, and Charles had promised
that “they shall find when God shall restore his Majesty
that he would extend that protection to them which they
could reasonably expect, and abate that rigour of the law
which was against them in his several dominions.”<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c015'><sup>[173]</sup></a> That
these negotiations were not without practical result is beyond
question, for the Da Costas and Coronels, as well as several
other Jewish families, were exceedingly active on Charles’s
behalf during the last few years of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must not be imagined that this Royalist activity represented
any double-dealing on the part of the Jews. Those
who, like Carvajal and De Caceres, had fled direct from
the Inquisition to England, were faithful to Cromwell to
the end. The Royalist Jews were men who had acquired
their Cavalier sympathies in France and Holland, and shared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxiv'>lxxiv</span>them with their Christian fellow-citizens in those countries.
None of them were parties to the negotiations with Cromwell
in 1655–56, and none had ever affected Puritan
sympathies. They probably had conscientious objections
to Republicanism, for they were of the aristocratic Sephardi
branch of Israel, with some of the bluest blood of Spain in
their veins and immense wealth in their strong-boxes. Their
dissent from their Puritan brethren was an early illustration
of the falsity of the hypothesis of Jewish political solidarity,
which is to this day a cherished delusion of the anti-Semites.</p>

<p class='c007'>Charles II. did not confine himself to ignoring the anti-Semitic
petitions. Having made up his mind that the Jews
should be protected, he sought, like Cromwell, to throw the
responsibility for his decision on the Constitutional Government.
Before the end of 1660 an Order of the Lords in
Council was sent to the House of Commons, recommending
that measures should be taken for the protection of the
Jews.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c015'><sup>[174]</sup></a> There is no record of any such measures having
been adopted. It was probably felt that the most convenient
course to pursue was to continue the policy of personal
connivance inaugurated by Cromwell, as by that means men’s
minds would be least disturbed, and an experiment which was
likely to produce good results would not be hampered. Moreover,
should the experiment fail, it would be all the easier to
deal with it if it had not received any legislative sanction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Accordingly, the Jews passed from the personal protection
of Cromwell to that of Charles. In 1664, when an
attempt was made by the Earl of Berkshire and Mr. Ricaut
to obtain their expulsion, the King in Council disavowed
the scheme, and assured the Jews “that they may promise
themselves the effects of the same favour as formerly they
have had so long as they demean themselves peaceably and
quietly with due obedience to his Majesty’s laws and without
scandal to his Government.<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c015'><sup>[175]</sup></a>” A similar course was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxv'>lxxv</span>taken by the Privy Council in 1673 and 1685, when
attempts were made by informers to prosecute the Jews for
the exercise of their religion.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c015'><sup>[176]</sup></a> Finally the King marked his
personal gratitude to the Jews by knighting Coronel soon
after the Restoration, and by a generous distribution of
patents of denization among the members of the Synagogue.<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c015'><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the Cromwellian settlement was confirmed, and
the path was definitely opened by which the Jews might
win their way to the citizenship of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>How that path was successfully trodden is a story which
cannot<a id='tlxxv'></a> be told in detail here. Its main feature, however,
must be briefly referred to, for it supplies the justification
for the campaign which Menasseh ben Israel
and Oliver Cromwell waged so gallantly on behalf of the
Hebrew people in the first half of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Jews won their way to English citizenship not
because they remained the <em>servi cameræ</em>, which had been
their status under the Norman and Angevin kings, and
which they had practically resumed under the Protectorate
and the Restoration, but because they literally realised the
portraiture of the Hebrew citizen which Menasseh ben
Israel vainly placed before the British nation in 1655 in
his tract, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Fidelitate et utilitate Judaicæ Gentis</span></cite>. In this
way they gradually substituted for the personal protection
of the Crown the sympathy and confidence of the nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their old enemies in the City of London were their
first converts. The wealth they brought into the country,
and their fruitful commercial activity, especially in the
colonial trade, soon revealed them as an indispensable
element of the prosperity of the City.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c015'><sup>[178]</sup></a> As early as 1668
Sir Josiah Child, the millionaire governor of the East
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxvi'>lxxvi</span>India Company, pleaded for their naturalisation on the
score of their commercial utility.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c015'><sup>[179]</sup></a> For the same reason
the City found itself compelled at first to connive
at their illegal representation on ’Change, and then to
violate its own rules by permitting them to act as brokers
without previously taking up the Freedom.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c015'><sup>[180]</sup></a> At this period
they controlled more of the foreign and colonial trade than
all the other alien merchants in London put together. The
momentum of their commercial enterprise and stalwart
patriotism proved irresistible. From the Exchange to the
City Council Chamber, thence to the Aldermanic Court,
and eventually to the Mayoralty itself, were inevitable
stages of an emancipation to which their large interests
in the City and their high character entitled them. Finally
the City of London—not only as the converted champion
of religious liberty but as the convinced apologist of the
Jews—sent Baron Lionel de Rothschild to knock at the
doors of the unconverted House of Commons as parliamentary
representative of the first city in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jewish emancipation in England was, in short, the work
of the English democracy—almost of the same democracy
which in the thirteenth century had spued the Hebrews
forth, when their kingly protectors had made their residence
in the land conditional on their acting as the usurious instruments
of the Royal Exchequer, and which in the seventeenth
had resented their readmission under the influence of deeply
rooted prejudices, inherited from that dark age. It was no
mere homage to the abstract principle of Religious Liberty
like the emancipations on the Continent which, in the name
of the Rights of Man, suddenly called forth the oppressed
Jews from their Ghettos and bade them take up a new life,
from which they were sundered by centuries of mediæval
seclusion. Religious Liberty in England broadened on
more cautious lines. Dissenters, Roman Catholics, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxvii'>lxxvii</span>Jews have each been taken into the bosom of the nation
by separate legislative action, and as the result of practical
demonstrations of the futility, nay, the disadvantage, of their
exclusion. The gradual emancipation of the English Jews,
first socially and then in the municipalities, enabled them
to show that their civic qualities entitled them to the fullest
rights of citizenship; and it was the realisation of this
fact—not by statesmen or philosophers, but by their neighbours
and fellow-citizens themselves—that eventually gave
them the position they now enjoy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The story of Jewish emancipation in England is the true
<em>Vindiciæ Judæorum</em>—the avenging of Menasseh’s broken
heart and the vindication of his touching trust in his
people. It is something more. It is one of many justifications
of that fine conception of statecraft, deeply
rooted in infinite sympathy with human freedom, which
is the secret of Britain’s greatness, and of which Oliver
Cromwell must ever be regarded as the typical exponent
in English history.</p>

<p class='c014'>The following is a selection of the documents referred
to in the foregoing narrative. They have been selected
chiefly on account of their personal bearing on Menasseh’s
efforts:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Fragment of a letter from Menasseh ben Israel to an
unknown correspondent in London (Harl. Miscel., vol. vii.

<p class='c007'>2. Abstract of a letter relating to the “Hope of Israel”
from Menasseh ben Israel to John Dury (Thorowgood,

Bonarum rerum Nuncie bone, in procinctune jam est, ut adveniat

<p class='c016'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Animus mihi fuit, citius adte scribendi, Vir egregie, otium
non fuit, Nec hodie ita mihi vacat, ut menti meæ, tantisque tuis
scriptis (quamvis expectatione paucioribus) satisfaciam. Nondum
de loco decem Tribuum, ex tuis literis responsum accepi; quod in
meis desideratum fuit; non astu, vel curiositate. Veritatem insequor,
ne Impostores pro Ebræis nobis obstrudantur. Scripsit quidam
nuperime, Innodos Novæ Angliæ decem Tribubus esse prognatos.
Alii Tartyros esse contendunt. Alii alios. Discrucior animi, ne
fallar, usque dum literas tuæ me fecerint certiorem. Delectari
videris D. Nicolai Apologiâ. Spero (ne glorier) te plura (ne dicam
majora) visurum, meo de Mille Annis prodeunte tractatu. Quod
opus ita me tenet occupatum, ut meæ ad te ituræ morentur literæ.
Martyres in tuis literis vox est; quæ, ni fallor, veteri Testamento
haud innotuit. Verum sub Novo, viri celebres, Christum, ejusque
Evangelium, ad mortem asserentes, primi illud nomen obtinuerunt.
Facilè tamen concedo, quoslibet veritatis alicujus testes, Martyres
Græce dictos fuisse. Sed (parcatur nostræ libertati Conscientiæ, quam
lubentissimè tibi inter scribendum indulsero) nec pontificii jam post
Concilium Tridentinum ullatenus habeantur propriè Christiani: nec
Martyrium esse mihi videatur, pro hodiernâ Legis Mosaicæ observatione
animam deponere. Quippe Lex illa quoad usum, ex plurimis
veteris Testamenti suffragiis, ante hoc abolenda esset. Deut. 18,
v. 18, 19. Psal. 50. v. 6–15, 23. Iesaiæ 66, v. 1–3. Vt olim
multis jam annis transactis, Iudei ubi maxima indulgetur libertas
non sacrificantes, vosmetipsos tamen vere Deum colere arbitramini,
Libet tamen, non obstanti hâc dicendi libertate nos edoceri, dedocerique,
quâ in re â veritate subsidimus, vel hallucinamur. Tractatum
itaque quem nominas <em>De debito Christianorum erga Ebræos affectu</em>,
mittas; ut quantum in me est, typis mandetur, &amp; in publicum
promoveamus. De tempore adventus Messiæ quod incertum pronuncias,
idque incertum comprobares experientiâ; in promptu est
responsio; Illud Danieli prius ignoranti, tandem revelatum est;
idque ex libris illius, nobis. Et quamvis nonnulli (quos nominas)
computando hallucinantes, in errorum gyris, &amp; labyrintho sunt involuti;
non tamen hâc ratione deponendæ sunt de eâ re (tanquam
nullius usus) Prophetiæ. Quippe quod expectamus, Danielis more
cap. 9. v. 2 &amp; v. 21. ut jam Vesperi ætatem, quo propius accedunt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxxii'>lxxxii</span>liberationum periodi, eo clarius elucescant revelationes ad easdem
spectantes. Ægyptii Ethnicorum barbariores (te teste Egregie Vir)
nascendum Mosen præsentiscebant, nescientibus tunc Israelitis
natum Liberatorem. Quidni etiam Christiani Scripturas amplexi,
adventum vestræ Messiæ secundum præviderent? In cujus adventu,
(pace eruditionis vestræ asserentis, quod stupens mirabar,
<em>Vestram salutem in ejus Adventu non esse sitam</em>) fundatur nostra, præsertim
vestra æterna salus. Si enim verum foret, eum nondum
venisse, &amp; posthæc illum venturum ambigitur, labitur omnis prophetiarum
Compages, totumque veteris Testamenti Systema ruit.
Et ita de Scripturarum veritate actum est; ut de salute tum nostrâ,
tum vestrâ actum est. Quæ si quippiam asserere videantur, Christi
Messiæ <em>passionem</em> (Psal. 22. Isa. 53) <em>resurrectionem</em> (Psal. 16)
<em>ascensionem</em> (Psal. 68) <em>sessionem ad dextram Patris</em> (Psal. 110)
<em>potestatem super omnia regnantem</em>, more Adami novissime creati
(Psal. 2. Psal. 8) omnino asserunt. Quæ omnia acurate comparata,
Messiæ Filii Davidis adventum, abitumque, reditumque, elenchicè
satis demonstrant. Non novum urgeo Testamentum, quod æquis
miraculorum portentis nobis commendatum fuit, ut vetus Israeli.
Vobis tamen Hebræis libentissimè favemus, utinamque plus multò
favere possemus; quamvis nec Meritum, nec pro merito (vox Bibliis
ignota) quicquam expectamus. Merces ex gratiâ datur non merito.
Malum possumus, qui perfecte peccamus, mereri; bonum in quo
omnimodo deficimus. Malum itaque pro nostro, bonum pro Christi
merito (si voce utar) nobis compensatur. Hominum (fateor) alter
de altero mereri dicatur, ut egomet tibi (vir Candidissime) pro tuis
literis me multum debere agnosco. Quin &amp; universa vestræ Nationi,
flexis genibus servire molior, ut sive Nos Vobis, Vosvè Nobis facti
Proselytæ utrique juxta Isaiam, &amp; Ezechielem, cæterosque Prophetas,
in unam coeamus ecclesiam. Nec non (confido) dilectissimus noster
Iesseus idem meditatur; cui literas communicavi tuas, ad me missas.
Pudet multum me tamdiu siluisse, verum tibi rescribenti, duplâ
quoad possim diligentiâ compensabitur.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>12. Petition on behalf of the widow of Menasseh ben

<p class='c016'>“To his Highness the Lord Protector the humble petition of
John Sadler.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sheweth that although your petitioner being often pressed to
present petitions in behalf of the Jewes did rather dissuade their
comming hither, yet by some letters of your late royall father &amp;
others of note in this nation some of their synagogs were encouraged
to send hither one of their cheife rabbines, Menasseh Ben Israel, for
admittance &amp; some freedome of trade in some of these ilands. And
when he had stayed heere so long, that he was allmost ashamed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxxviii'>lxxxviii</span>returne to those that sent him or to exact their maintenance heere
where they found so little success after so many hopes, it pleased his
Highnes &amp; the councell to setle on the said Menasseh a pension of
100£ a yeare which ere long he offered to resigne for 300£ for
present satisfaction of debts &amp; other pressures which lay so heavy on
him that at length he submitted to resigne his former pension for a
new grant of 200£ to be presently paid as the councell ordered.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But notwithstanding his stay &amp; expense in procuring several
seales, he never gott one penny of the said 200£ but at length with
his heart ever broken with griefe on losing heer his only sonne and
his presious time with all his hopes in this iland he got away with
so much breath as lasted, till he came to Midleburg &amp; then he dyed.
Leaving a poore desolate widow (with other relations) who solemnly
professed she had not money enough to lay him in the sepulchres of
his fathers, but for the charity of some that lent or gave them money.
It pleased allso your Highess late father to receive one or 2 of the
same poore widowes letters to your petitioner (whom they both
trusted in that business) &amp; with his owne hands to commit them to
the especiall care of Mr. secretary Thurloe who hath also divers
times minded the same, but your Highness exchequer is so charged
that there is little hope of obteining it there.</p>

<p class='c016'>“May it please your Highnesse in compassion to the said poore
widow &amp; relations of a man so eminent &amp; famous in his owne &amp;
meny other nations &amp; for the honour of Christian religion with
many other reasons, to order the said 200£ out of the contingencies
for the councell or some other treasure where it may be speedily
had and without fees allso if it may be according to former orders.</p>

It is not one cause alone (most renowned Fathers)
which useth to move those, who desire
by their Meditations to benefit Mankind, and
to make them come forth in publique, to dedicate
their Books to great Men; for some,
and those the most, are incited by Covetousnesse, that
they may get money by so doing, or some peece of
Plate of gold, or Silver; sometimes also that they may
obtaine their Votes, and suffrages to get some place for
themselves, or their friends. But some are moved thereto
by meere and pure friendship, that so they may publickly
testifie that love and affection, which they bear them,
whose names they prefixe to their Books; let the one, and
the other, please themselves, according as they delight in
the reason of the Dedication, whether it be good or bad;
for my part, I best like them, who do it upon this ground,
that they may not commend themselves, or theirs, but
what is for publick good.</p>

<p class='c007'>As for me (most renowned Fathers) in my dedicating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>this Discourse to you, I can truly affirm, that I am induced
to it upon no other ground then this, that I may gain
your favour and good will to our Nation, now scattered
almost all over the earth; neither think that I do this, as if
I were ignorant how much you have hitherto favored our
Nation; for it is made known to me, and to others of our
Nation, by them who are so happy as near at hand, to
observe your apprehensions, that you do vouchsafe to help
us, not onely by your prayers; yea, this hath compelled
me to speak to you publickly, and to give you thanks for
that your charitable affection towards us, and not such
thanks which come only from the tongue, but as are conceived
by a grateful mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Give me leave therefore (most renowned Fathers) to
supplicate you, that you would stil favor our good, and farther
love us. Truly, we men doe draw so much the nearer
to Divine nature, when by how much we increase, by
so much we cherish, and defend the small, and weak ones;
and with how much diligence doe you performe this, most
renowned Fathers? who though you seem to be arrived
to the highest top of felicity, yet you do not only not despise
inferior men, but you so wish well to them, that you
seem sensible of their calamity; you knowing how acceptable
to God you are by so doing, who loves to do good to
them who doe good. And truly it is from hence, that of
late you have done so great things valiantly, and by an unusuall
attempt, and things much to be observed among
the Nations. The whole world stands amazed at these
things, and the eies of all are turned upon you, that they
may see whither all these things do tend, which the great
Governour of all things seems to bring upon the world by
so great changes, so famously remarkable, of so many Nations;
and so all those things which God is pleased to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>have fore-told by the Prophets, do, and shall obtain their
accomplishment. All which things of necessity must bee
fulfilled, that so <em>Israel</em> at last being brought back to his
owne place; peace which is promised under the Messiah,
may be restored to the world; and concord, which is the
only Mother of al good things. These things I handle more
largely in this Treatise, which I dedicate to you (most renowned
Fathers) you cannot be ignorant, that it is not only
not unprofitable, but very useful for States and Statesmen,
to fore-see the issue (which yet is ever in Gods
hand) of humaine Councells, that so they may observe,
and understand from Divine truth, the events of things to
come, which God hath determined by his Spirit in his
holy Prophets. I know that this my labour will not be
unacceptable to you, how mean soever it be, which I trust
you will chearfully receive, because that you love our Nation,
and as part of it, the Author of this Discourse. But
I intreat you be certain, that I pour out continual prayers
to God for your happinesse. Farewell, most renowned
Fathers, and flourish most prosperously.</p>

<em>There are as many minds as men, about the originall of
the people of</em> America <em>and of the first Inhabitants of the
new World, and of the</em> West Indyes; <em>for how many men
soever they were or are, they came of those two</em>, Adam,
<em>and</em> Eve; <em>and consequently of</em> Noah, <em>after the Flood, but
that new World doth seem wholly separated from the old,
therefore it must be that some did passe thither out of one (at least) of
the three parts of the world sc.</em> Europe, Asia, <em>and</em> Africa; <em>but the doubt
is, what people were those, and out of what place they went. Truly,
the truth of that must be gathered, partly out of the ancient Hystories,
and partly from conjectures; as their Habit, their Language,
their Manners, which yet doe vary according to mens dispositions;
so that it is hard to finde out the certainty. Almost all
who have viewed<a id='t6'></a> those Countryes, with great diligence, have been
of different judgements: Some would have the praise of finding out</em>
America, <em>to be due to the</em> Carthaginians, <em>others to the</em> Phenicians, <em>or
the</em> Canaanites; <em>others to the</em> Indians, <em>or people of</em> China; <em>others
to them of</em> Norway, <em>others to the Inhabitants of the</em> Atlantick Islands,
<em>others to the</em> Tartarians, <em>others to the ten Tribes. Indeed, every one
grounds his opinion not upon probable arguments, but high conjectures,
as will appeare farther by this Booke. But I having curiously
examined what ever hath hitherto been writ upon this subject
doe finde no opinion more probable, nor agreeable to reason, then
that of our</em> Montezinus, <em>who saith, that the first inhabitants of</em> America,
<em>were the ten Tribes of the</em> Israelites, <em>whom the</em> Tartarians
<em>conquered, and drove away; who after that (as God would have it)
hid themselves behind the Mountaines</em> Cordilleræ. <em>I also shew,
that as they were not driven out at once from their Country, so
also they were scattered into divers Provinces, sc. into</em> America,
<em>into</em> Tartary, <em>into</em> China, <em>into</em> Media, <em>to the Sabbaticall River, and
into</em> Æthiopia. <em>I prove that the ten Tribes never returned to the
second Temple, that they yet keepe the Law of</em> Moses, <em>and our sacred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Rites; and at last shall return into their Land, with the
two Tribes</em>, Judah, <em>and</em> Benjamin; <em>and shall be governed by one
Prince, who is</em> Messiah <em>the Son of</em> David; <em>and without doubt that
time is near, which I make appear by divers things; where, Reader,
thou shalt finde divers Histories worthy of memory, and many
Prophesies of the old Prophets opened with much study, and care.
I willingly leave it to the judgement of the godly, and learned, what
happy worth there is in this my Book, and what my own Nation owes
me for my paines: It is called</em>, The Hope of Israel; <em>which name
is taken from</em> Jerem. 14.8. <em>O the hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof.
For the scope of this Discourse is, to show, that the hope in which
we live, of the comming of the Messiah is of a future, difficult, but infallible
good, because it is grounded upon the absolute Promise of the
blessed God.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><em>And because I intend a continuation of</em> Josephus <em>his History of
the</em> Jewes, <em>our famous Historian; I intreat, and beseech all Learned
men, in what part of the world soever they live (to whom I
hope that shortly this Discourse will come) that if they have any
thing worthy of posterity, that they would give me notice of it in time;
for though I have collected many Acts of the</em> Jewes, <em>and many
Hystories out of the</em> Hebrewes, <em>the</em> Arabians, <em>the</em> Grecians, <em>the</em> Latines,
<em>and other Authors of other Nations; yet I want many things for
this my enterprize, all which I am willing to performe, that I may
please my Nation; but rather to the glory of the blessed God, whose
Kingdome is everlasting, and his Word infallible</em>.</p>

This discourse of a Jew comming to my hand, and
having perused it, I thought it not inconvenient
to make it speake <em>English</em>; for the benefit of my
Country-men, who wait for the redemption of <em>Israel</em>;
and at the same time of the <em>Gentiles</em> also. That
the Author is a <em>Jew</em>, ought to be no scandall to us (though
some of us Christian <em>Gentiles</em> are ignorant of, and scandalized at
the notion of the conversion of the <em>Jewes</em>, as the <em>Jewes</em> of old
were, concerning our being converted, and grafted into the true
Stock, as in <em>Acts</em> 11.3.) for though God hath rejected them,
yet not for ever: <em>Rom.</em> 11.25, 26. And also the many prophesies
both in the Old, and New Testament, which concern their being
received againe to grace, gathered from their dispersion,
and settled in their own Land; and their flourishing estate under,
now our, and then their and our Prince, Jesus Christ the
Messiah, who will then triumph gloriously, and all his people
with him; these and many more Promises would want a fulfilling
(which the God of Truth wil never suffer) if there should
not be the revolution of a time, in which they shall be converted,
and grace and peace be poured out upon <em>Jewes</em> and <em>Gentiles</em>;
though first upon the <em>Jew</em>, then the <em>Gentile</em>. But besides this, the
Author expresseth so much learning that he deserveth honour
of all; so much ingenuity, and (so far as his light reacheth) so
great a measure of the knowledge and fear of God, that he may
wel be set for a pattern to us Christians, who profess much better
than he, but live much worse. One thing is very remarkable in
him, that wheras many of us (like them who canot see Wood for
Trees) though inviorned with mercies in these late revolutions,
(I speake not to them who measure mercies only, or chiefly, by
plentiful tables, ful purses, rich accoutrements, and the like; that
wretched Generation is unworthy of the name of <em>Men</em>, much
more of <em>Christians</em>) yet will unthankfully cry out, What have
we got by all these troubles? and what hath been done? surely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>this <em>Jew</em> shall rise up in judgement against such unchristian
Christians; for he in his Epistle Dedicatory says, <em>The whole world
stands amazed at what the Parliament hath done</em>; besides he cordially
and openly owns the Parliament, who as far as I know never did
him nor his Nation any further good then to pray for them;
(<em>though we hope, and pray, that their favour may extend to realities, towards
that people to whom certainly God hath made many, and great
Promises, and shortly will give answerable performances</em>:) but
many among us who injoy peace under them, and many other
blessings, (too many for an unthankfull Generation) doe refuse
to acknowledge them, doe curse them whom God hath
blessed, and even in their prayers to that God who cannot be
deceived, or imposed upon; doe vent themselves against this
present Government, in expressions so wilde and false, that
such Language would be accounted most unworthy, in our
addresse to any considerable person, much more then to the
great God. I shall only adde this, <em>sc.</em> Do not think that I aime
by this Translation, to propagate or commend <em>Iudaisme</em> (which
its no wonder if the Author doth so much favour, especially in
his thirtieth Section) no, through Grace I have better learned the
truth, as it is in Jesus, but to give some discovery of what apprehensions,
and workings there are at this day in the hearts of the
<em>Jewes</em>; and to remove our sinfull hatred from off that people,
whose are the Promises, and who are beloved for their Fathers
sakes; and who of <em>Jewes</em>, we shall hear to be, ere long, reall Christians.</p>

<em>In the 18th. of the Month of</em> Elul: <em>the 5404 year
from the Worlds creation, and according to common
compute, in 1644</em>. Aaron Levi, <em>otherwise
called</em> Antonius Montezinus <em>came into this City</em>
Amsterdam, <em>and related to the Sieur</em> Menasseh ben
Israel, <em>and other cheifetains of the</em> Portugal <em>Nation,
Inhabitants of the same City, these things which follow</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>That it was two years and a halfe, since that he going from
the Port</em> Honda <em>in the</em> West-Indies, <em>to the</em> Papian <em>jurisdiction, he
conducted some Mules of a certaine</em> Indian, <em>whose name was</em> Franciscus
Castellanus, <em>into the Province of</em> Quity, <em>and that there was
one in company with him and other</em> Indians, <em>whose name was</em> Francis,
<em>who was called by all</em> Cazicus. <em>That it happened that as they
went over the Mountaines</em> Cordilleræ, <em>a great tempest arose, which
threw the loaden Mules to the ground. The</em> Indians <em>being afflicted
by the sore tempest, every one began to count his losses;
yet confessing that all that and more grievous punishments were but
just, in regard of their many sins. But</em> Francis <em>bad them take it patiently,
for that they should shortly injoy rest: the others answered, that
they were unworthy of it; yea that the notorious cruelty used by the</em>
Spaniards <em>towards them, was sent of God, because they had so ill treated
his holy people, who wer of al others the most innocent: now then,
they determined to stay all night upon the top of the Mountain.
And</em> Montezinus <em>tooke out of a Box some Bread, and Cheese,
and Jonkets, and gave them to</em> Francis, <em>upbraiding him, that he
had spoken disgracefully of the</em> Spaniards; <em>who answered, that he
had not told one halfe of the miseries and calamities inflicted by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>cruell, and inhumane people; but they should not goe unrevenged,
looking for helpe from an unknown people</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>After this Conference</em>, Montezinus <em>went to</em> Carthagenia, <em>a City
of the</em> Indians, <em>where he being examined, was put in Prison; and
while he prayed to God, such words fell from him; Blessed be the
name of the Lord, that hath not made me an Idolater, a</em> Barbarian,
<em>a</em> Black-a-Moore, <em>or an</em> Indian; <em>but as he named</em> Indian, <em>he was
angry with himselfe, and said, The</em> Hebrewes <em>are</em> Indians; <em>then he
comming to himselfe againe; confessed that he doted, and added,
Can the</em> Hebrewes <em>be</em> Indians? <em>which hee also repeated a second, and
a third time; and he thought that it was not by chance that he had
so much mistaken himselfe</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>He thinking farther, of what he had heard from the</em> Indian, <em>and
hoping that he should find out the whole truth; therefore as soon as
he was let out of Prison, he sought out</em> Franciscus <em>beleeving that hee
would repeat to him againe what he had spoken; he therefore being
set at liberty, through Gods mercy went to the Port</em>
Honda, <em>and according to his desire, found him, who said; He
remembred all that he had spoken, when he was upon the Mountaine;
whom</em> Montezinus <em>asked, that he would take a journy with
him, offering him all courtesies, giving him three peeces of Eight,
that he might buy himselfe necessaries</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Now when they were got out of the City</em>, Montezinus <em>confessed
himselfe to be an</em> Hebrew, <em>of the Tribe of</em> Levi, <em>and that the Lord
was his God; and he told the</em> Indian, <em>that all other gods were but
mockeries; the</em> Indian <em>being amazed, asked him the name of his
Parents; who answered</em> Abraham, Isaac, <em>and</em> Jacob; <em>but said he,
have you no other Father? who answered, yes, his Fathers name
was</em> Ludovicus Montezinus; <em>but he not being yet satisfied, I am
glad (saith he) to heare you tell this, for I was in doubt to beleeve
you, while you seemed ignorant of your Parents</em>: Montezinus <em>swearing,
that he spoke the truth, the</em> Indian <em>asked him, if he were not
the Son of</em> Israel, <em>and thereupon began a long discourse; who when
he knew that he was so, he desired him to prosecute what he had
begun, and added, that he should more fully explaine himselfe, for
that formerly he had left things so doubtfull, that he did not seem
at all assured of any thing. After that both had sate downe
together, and refreshed themselves, the</em> Indian <em>thus began: If you
have a minde to follow me your Leader, you shall know what ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>you desire to know, only let me tell you this, whatsoever the journey
is, you must foot it, and you must eate nothing but parched</em> Mayz,
<em>and you must omit nothing that I tell you</em>; Montezinus <em>answered
that he would doe all</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The next day being Munday</em>, Cazicus <em>came againe, and bid
him throw away what he had in his Knapsack to put on shooes made
of linnen packthred, and to follow him, with his staffe; whereupon</em>
Montezinus <em>leaving his Cloake, and his Sword, and other things
which he had about him, they began the journey, the</em> Indian <em>carrying
upon his back three measures of</em> Mayz, <em>two ropes, one of which
was full of knots, to climbe up the Mountaine, with an hooked fork;
the other was so loose, for to passe over Marshes, and Rivers, with
a little Axe, and shooes made of linnen pack-thred. They being
thus accoutred, travelled the whole weeke, unto the Sabbath Day;
on which day they resting, the day after they went on, till Tuesday,
on which day about eight a clock in the morning, they came to a River
as bigge as</em> Duerus; <em>then the</em> Indian <em>said, Here you shall see your
Brethren, and making a signe with the fine linnen of</em> Xylus, <em>which
they had about them instead of a Girdle; thereupon on the other
side of the River they saw a great smoke, and immediately after,
such another signe made as they had made before; a little after
that, three men, with a woman, in a little Boat came to them, which
being come neare, the woman went ashore, the rest staying in the
Boat; who talking a good while with the</em> Indian, <em>in a Language
which</em> Montezinus <em>understood not; she returned to the Boat, and told
to the three men what she had learned of the</em> Indian; <em>who alwayes
eying him, came presently out of the Boat, and embraced</em> Montezinus,
<em>the woman after their example doing the like; after which, one
of them went back to the Boat, and when the</em> Indian <em>bowed downe to
the feet of the other two, and of the woman, they embraced him
courteously, and talked a good while with him. After that, the</em>
Indian <em>bid</em> Montezinus <em>to be of good courage, and not to looke that
they should come a second time to him, till he had fully learned the
things which were told him at the first time</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Then those two men comming on each side of</em> Montezinus, <em>they
spoke in Hebrew, the 4th. ver. of</em> Deut. 6. Semah Israel, adonai Elohenu
adonai ehad; <em>that is</em>, Heare O Israel, the Lord our God is one God.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Then the</em> Indian <em>Interpreter being asked, how it was in</em> Spanish,
<em>they spoke what followes to</em> Montezinus, <em>making a short pause between
every particular</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>1 Our Fathers are <em>Abraham</em>, <em>Isaac</em>, <em>Jacob</em>, and <em>Israel</em>, and
they signified these foure by the three fingers lifted up; then they
joyned <em>Reuben</em>, adding another finger to the former three.</p>

<p class='c007'>2 We will bestow severall places on them who have a minde to
live with us.</p>

<p class='c007'>3 <em>Joseph</em> dwels in the midst of the Sea, they making a signe by
two fingers put together, and then parted them.</p>

<p class='c007'>4 They said (speaking fast) shortly some of us will goe forth to
see, and to tread under foot; at which word they winked, and stamped
with their feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>5 One day we shall all of us talke together, they saying, Ba, ba,
ba; and we shall come forth as issuing out of our Mother the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>6 A certaine Messenger shall goe forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>7 <em>Franciscus</em> shall tell you somewhat more of these things, they
making a signe with their finger, that much must not be spoken.</p>

<p class='c007'>8 Suffer us that we may prepare ourselves; and they turning their
hands and faces every way, thus prayed to God, DO NOT STAY
LONG.</p>

<p class='c007'>9 Send twelve men, they making a signe, that they would have
men that had beards, and who are skilfull in writing.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The Conference being ended, which lasted a whole day, the same
men returned on Wednesday, and Thursday, and spake the same
things againe, without adding a word; at last</em> Montezinus <em>being
weary that they did not answer what he asked them, nor would
suffer him to goe over the river, he cast himselfe into their Boat;
but he being forced out againe, fell into the River, and was in danger
to be drowned, for he could not swim; but being got out of the
water, the rest being angry, said to him; attempt not to passe the
River, nor to enquire after more then we tel you; which the</em> Indian
<em>interpreted to him, the rest declaring the same things both by signs,
and words</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>You must observe, that all those three dayes the Boat stayed not
in the same place, but when those foure who came went away, other
foure came, who all as with one mouth, repeated all the fore-mentioned
nine particulars, there came and went about three hundred.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><em>Those men are somewhat scorched by the Sun, some of them
weare their haire long, downe to their knees, other of them shorter,
and others of them much as we commonly cut it. They were comely
of body, well accoutred, having ornaments on their feet, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>leggs, and their heads were compassed about with a linnen cloath.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Montezinus <em>saith, that when he was about to be gone, on Thursday
evening, they shewed him very much courtesie, and brought
him whatever they thought fit for him in his journey, and they
said, that themselves were well provided with all such things</em>, (sc.
<em>meats, garments, flocks, and other things</em>) <em>which the</em> Spaniards <em>in</em>
India <em>call their owne</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The same day, when they came to the place where they had
rested, the night before they came to the River</em>, Montezinus <em>said to
the</em> Indian; <em>You remember</em> Francis, <em>that my Brethren told me, that
you should tell me something, therefore I entreat you, that you
would not thinke much to relate it. The</em> Indian <em>answered, I will
tell you what I know, only doe not trouble me, and you shall know
the truth, as I have received it from my fore-fathers; but if you
presse me too much, as you seeme to doe, you will make me tell you
lyes; attend therefore I pray, to what I shall tell you</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Thy Brethren are the Sons of</em> Israel, <em>and brought thither by the
providence of God, who for their sake wrought many Miracles,
which you will not beleeve, if I should tell you what I have learned
from my Fathers; we</em> Indians <em>made war upon them in that place,
and used them more hardly then we now are by the</em> Spaniards; <em>then
by the instigation of our Magicians</em> (<em>whom we call</em> Mohanes) <em>we
went armed to that place where you saw your Brethren, with an
intent to destroy them; but not one of all those who went thither,
came back againe; whereupon we raised a great Army, and set
upon them, but with the same successe, for againe none escaped;
which hapned also the third time, so that</em> India <em>was almost bereft
of all inhabitants, but old men, and women, the old men therefore:
and the rest who survived, beleeving that the Magicians used
false dealing, consulted to destroy them all, and many of them being
killed those who remained promised to discover somewhat that
was not knowne; upon that they desisted from cruelty, and they
declared such things as follow</em>:</p>

<p class='c007'>That the God of those Children of <em>Israel</em> is the true God, that all
that which is engraven upon their stones is true; that about the end
of the World they shall be Lords of the world; that some shall
come who shall bring you much good, and after that they have
enriched the earth with all good things, those Children of <em>Israel</em> going
forth out of their Country, shall subdue the whole World to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>them, as it was subject to them formerly; you shall be happy if you
make a League with them.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Then five of the chiefe</em> Indians (<em>whom they call</em> Cazici) <em>who
were my Ancestors, having understood the Prophesie of the Magicians,
which they had learned of the Wise men of the</em> Hebrewes,
<em>went thither, and after much entreaty, obtained their desire, having
first made knowne their minde to that woman, whom you saw
to be for an Interpreter</em>, (<em>for your Brethren will have no commerce
with our</em> Indians) <em>and whosoever of ours doth enter the
Country of your Brethren, they presently kill him; and none of your
Brethren doe passe into our Country. Now by the help of that
Woman we made this agreement with them.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>1 That our five <em>Cazici</em> should come to them, and that alone at
every seventy moneths end.</p>

<p class='c007'>2 That he to whom secrets should be imparted, should be above
the age of three hundred Moones, or Months.</p>

<p class='c007'>3 And that such things should be discovered to none in any place
where people are, but only in a Desart, and in the presence of the
<em>Cazici</em>; and so (said the <em>Indian</em>) we keep that secret among our
selves, because that we promise our selves great favour from them,
for the good offices which we have done to our Brethren, it is not
lawfull for us to visite them, unlesse at the seventy months end: Or
if there happens any thing new, and this fell out but thrice in my
time; First, when the <em>Spaniards</em> came into this Land; also, when
Ships came into the Southerne Sea; and thirdly, when you came,
whom they long wished for, and expected. They did much rejoyce
for those three new things, because that they said, the Prophesies were
fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>And</em> Montezinus <em>also said, that three other</em> Cazici <em>were sent to
him by</em> Franciscus, <em>to</em> Honda, <em>yet not telling their names, till he had
said, you may speake to them freely, they are my fellowes in my
Function of whom I have told you, the fifth could not come for
age, but those three did heartily embrace him; and</em> Montezinus
<em>being asked of what Nation he was, he answered, an</em> Hebrew, <em>of
the Tribe of</em> Levi, <em>and that God was his God, &amp;c. which when
they had heard, they embraced him againe, and said: Upon a time
you shall see us, and shall not know us; We are all your Brethren, by
Gods singular favour; and againe, they both of them bidding farewell,
departed, every one saying, I goe about my businesse; therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>none but</em> Franciscus <em>being left, who saluting</em> Montezinus <em>as a
Brother, then bade him farewell, saying, farewell my Brother, I
have other things to doe, and I goe to visite thy Brethren, with other</em>
Hebrew <em>Cazici. As for the Country, be secure, for we rule all
the</em> Indians; <em>after we have finished a businesse which we have with
the wicked</em> Spaniards, <em>we will bring you out of your bondage, by Gods
help; not doubting, but he who cannot lye, will help us; according to
his Word; endeavour you in the meane while that those men may
come</em>.</p>

It is hard to say what is certaine among the so many,
and so uncertaine opinions concerning the
originall of the <em>Indians</em> of the new World. If
you aske, what is my opinion upon the relation
of <em>Montezinus</em>, I must say, it is scarce possible
to know it by any Art, since there is no demonstration,
which can manifest the truth of it;
much lesse can you gather it from Divine, or humane Writings; for
the Scriptures doe not tell what people first inhabited those Countries;
neither was there mention of them by any, til <em>Christop. Columbus</em>,
<em>Americus</em>, <em>Vespacius</em>, <em>Ferdinandus</em>, <em>Cortez</em>, the Marquesse
<em>Del Valle</em>, and <em>Franciscus Pizarrus</em> went thither; and though hitherto
I have been of this minde, that I would speake only of solid,
and infallible things, (as those things are which concerne our Law)
and the obscurity of the matter, making me doubt, whether it would
be worth a while for me to attempt it; yet at last I was content to be
perswaded to it, not that I looke to get credit by it, but that my
friends, and all who seeke for truth, that have put me upon this
work, may see how very desirous I am to please them.</p>

<p class='c007'>I shall speake somewhat in this Discourse, of the divers opinions
which have been, and shall declare in what Countries it is thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the ten Tribes are; and I shall close, after that I have brought them
into their owne Country, which I shall prove by good reasons, following
the Revelations of the holy Prophets, who I beleeve cannot be
expounded otherwise, whatever some thinke; yet I intend not to dispute
these things, but according to my custome, shall lay down fairly,
and faithfully, the opinions of the <em>Jewes</em> only.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 2.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>You must know therefore, that <em>Alexis Vanegas</em> saith, that the
first Colonies of the <em>West-Indies</em> were of the <em>Carthaginians</em>, who
first of all inhabited <em>New-Spaine</em>, and as they encreased, spread to
the Island <em>Cuba</em>; from thence to the continent of <em>America</em>; and after
that towards <em>Panama</em>, <em>New-Spaine</em>, and the Isle of <em>Peru</em>. And
he grounds himselfe on that reason, that as the <em>Carthaginians</em> (who
of old did most use the Seas) so those of <em>Peru</em>, and the Inhabitants of
<em>New-Spaine</em>, did make use of Pictures instead of Letters.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this opinion doth not satisfie, because they anciently were
white men, bearded, and civill in converse; but contrarily those of
<em>Panama</em>, St. <em>Martha</em>, and the Isles in <em>Cuba</em>, and <em>Barlovent</em>, went
naked. Further-more, who can thinke that the language which he
saith, they first spoke, should be so soone changed, that it should be
wholly another; and there is no agreement between the one and the
other. The learned <em>Arias Montanus</em> thinkes, that the <em>Indians</em> of
<em>New-Spaine</em>, and <em>Peru</em>, are the Off-spring of <em>Ophir</em> the sonne of
<em>Jokton</em>, the nephew of <em>Heber</em>. And he backes his opinion, by the
name <em>Ophir</em>, which by transposition of letters, is the same with <em>Peru</em>;
and he adds, that the name <em>Parvaim</em> in the duall number, doth signifie
the <em>Istmus</em> between <em>New-Spaine</em> and <em>Peru</em>, which first was
called <em>Ophir</em>, then <em>Peru</em>; and that these Countries are that <em>Peru</em>,
from whence King <em>Solomon</em> brought Gold, precious Stones, &amp;c., as
in <em>1 King.</em> <em>chap.</em> 9. <em>v.</em> 10. &amp; <em>2 Chron.</em> 9.21. This opinion seems
more probable than the other, and may be backed by another name of
the River <em>Piru</em>, which according to <em>Gomoras</em>, lyes in the second degree
from the Equinoctiall line, from <em>Panama</em> 222. miles; as also
by the name of the Province <em>Jucatan</em>, which may be derived from
<em>Joktan</em> the father of <em>Ophir</em>. But besides that this notation is somewhat
farre fetcht, it crosses what <em>Josephus Acosta</em> affirmes in <em>1. Histor.</em>
of <em>Jud.</em> <em>c.</em> 13. who saith, that the name <em>Peru</em> was unknowne to
the <em>Indians</em> themselves before those <em>Spaniards</em> gave that name. Add
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>to this what <em>Garcillasso de la Vega</em> in the first part of his Commentary
on <em>Peru</em>, <em>c.</em> 4. saith, that when a certaine <em>Spanyard, Basco Nunnez
de Balboa</em>, lived in that Country, and asked a Fisher-man, what
was the name of that Province, he answered <em>Beru</em>; (which was the
Fisher-mans owne name, he thinking that was the question) and he
farther said, that the name of the River where he fished, was called
<em>Pelu</em>. Hence you may see, that <em>Peru</em> is made of both those words;
which also many <em>Spanyards</em> besides him, we have mentioned, doe
testifie. Besides, who can thinke that <em>Solomon</em> neglecting the <em>East-Indies</em>,
a place so rich, and abounding with all things, should send a
Fleet so farre off as to the <em>West-Indies</em>. Also we read in <em>1 King.</em> 9.
that <em>Solomon</em> made ships in <em>Ezion-Geber</em> on the shoare of the red
Sea, which also <em>Jehosaphat</em> did, with <em>Ahaziah</em>, as <em>Ezra</em> saith, in
<em>2 Chron.</em> 20. and it is certaine that those of those Countries went that
ordinary way to <em>India</em>. And it will not follow, that because the holy
Scripture sometimes saith, that they went to <em>Tarsis</em>, and sometimes;
that they went to <em>Ophir</em>, that therefore both those places are the same;
since that <em>Tarsis</em> is not, as some thinke <em>Carthage</em>, or <em>Tunes</em> in <em>Africa</em>
for that the Navie of <em>Solomon</em> did not set sayle from <em>Joppa</em>, a port of
the Mediterranean, but from <em>Ezion-Geber</em>, a Port of the red Sea,
from whence they could not sayle to <em>Carthage</em>, but to the <em>East-Indies</em>.
The answer of <em>Isaac Abarbanel</em> to that argument, cannot be admitted,
who saith, that an arme of <em>Nilus</em> did run into the red Sea, and
another arme ran into the Mediterranean, by <em>Alexandria</em> in <em>Ægypt</em>;
since it was never heard, that ships of great burden, did swim in those
rivers; and would not he then have built his Navie in the Port of <em>Alexandria</em>?
It is more true that <em>Tarsis</em> is the Ocean, or <em>Indian</em> Sea;
and because they came into the Ocean, after that they had sayled over
the red Sea, which is but narrow, therefore the Scripture saith, <em>They
Sayled</em> to Tarsis. <em>Rabbi Jonathan ben Uziel</em> followes this opinion,
who in his Paraphrase, for <em>Tarsis</em>, puts (the Sea.) The same saith
<em>Franciscus de Ribera</em>, in his Comment. on <em>Jonah</em>, and also <em>Rabbinus
Josephus Coen</em>, in his <em>Chronology</em>; who ascribe the word <em>Tarsis</em>, to
the <em>Indian</em> Sea; because that <em>Ophir</em> is the same Country, which of
old is called, <em>The Golden Chersonesus</em>; and by <em>Josephus</em>, <em>The Golden
Land</em>; and at this day <em>Malacca</em>; from whence they brought
Ivory, for the great number of Elephants which are there; none of
which are in the <em>West-Indies</em>, and <em>Solomons</em> Navie stayed in those
Ports of <em>India</em> three yeares, because they traded with the Inhabitants!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>I know that learned <em>Grotius</em>, and famous <em>de Laet</em> thinke
differently; as also those quoted by them; but I shall not insist
in confuting their opinions because I study brevity. I doe like of, in
part, the opinion of the <em>Spaniards</em> who dwell in the <em>Indies</em>, who
by common consent doe affirme that the <em>Indians</em> come of the
ten Tribes. And truly they are not altogether mistaken, because in
my opinion, <em>they were the first planters of the Indies</em>; as also other
people of the <em>East-Indies</em> came by that Streight which is between
<em>India</em>, and the Kingdome of <em>Anian</em>. But that people, according to
our <em>Montezinus</em>, made warre upon those Inhabitants the <em>Israelites</em>,
whom they forced up unto the mountaines, and the in-land Countries,
as formerly the <em>Brittaines</em> were driven by the <em>Saxons</em> into
<em>Wales</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 3.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The first ground of that opinion is taken from <em>2 Esdra.</em> 13. <em>v.</em>
40. &amp;c. (which we quote as ancient, though it be Apocryphall)
where it’s said, that the ten Tribes which <em>Salmanaster</em> carried
captive in the reigne of <em>Hoseas</em>, beyond <em>Euphrates</em>, determined
to goe into Countries farre remote, in which none dwelt, whereby
they might the better observe their Law. And as they passed over
some branches of <em>Euphrates</em>, God wrought Miracles, stopping the
course of the Floud, till they had passed over; and that Country is
called <em>Arsareth</em>. From whence we may gather, that the ten Tribes
went to <em>New-Spaine</em>, and <em>Peru</em>, and possessed those two Kingdoms,
till then without Inhabitants. <em>Genebrardus</em>, quoting <em>Esdras</em> concerning
that wandring of the ten Tribes, saith, that <em>Arsareth</em> is <em>Tartaria</em>
the greater, and from thence they went to <em>Greenland</em>, for that
<em>America</em> is lately found to be on that side farther from Sea, than it is
upon other sides, being almost an Island, and they might passe from
<em>Greenland</em> by the streight of <em>Davis</em> into the Country <em>Labrador</em>,
which is now called <em>India</em>, being fifty miles distant from thence, as
<em>Gomoras</em> saith in his History. The same journying of the ten Tribes
into <em>India</em>, is confirmed by that which <em>P. Malvenda</em> reports, That
<em>Arsareth</em> is that Promontory which is neare to <em>Scythia</em>, or <em>Tartary</em>,
neare the Sea, called by <em>Pliny</em>, <em>Tabis</em>, where <em>America</em> is parted
from the Country of <em>Anian</em> by a narrow Sea; which also on that side
parts <em>China</em>, or <em>Tartary</em> from <em>America</em>; so that there might be an
easie passage for the ten Tribes through <em>Arsareth</em>, or <em>Tartary</em> into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the Kingdomes of <em>Anian</em>, and <em>Quivira</em>; which in time might plant
the new world, and firme land; which in bignesse equals <em>Europe</em>,
<em>Asia</em>, and <em>Africa</em> put together; <em>Alonsus Augustinianus</em> counting
from the shoare of the North Sea, from the Country of <em>Labrador</em>
3928 miles, and from <em>Sur</em> 3000. miles; but <em>Gomaras</em> counts from
<em>India</em> by the South, and <em>Sur</em>, 9300. miles; which space is bigge enough
for the ten Tribes, that they may there spread in places hitherto
unknowne.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 4.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>He strengthens this opinion, that in the Isle St. <em>Michael</em>, which
belongs to the <em>Azores</em>, the <em>Spaniards</em> found Sepulchres under
ground, with very ancient Hebrew letters, which <em>Genebrardus</em> hath
Printed, <em>in lib.</em> <em>1. chro.</em> <em>p.</em> 159. From whence we gather, that in that
inscription there is a mistake of the letter (T.) so that the sense of it
is, <em>How perfect is God. Sehalbin is dead. Know God.</em> Unlesse you
will have them to be proper Names, and to signifie him that is dead,
and his Father, in which sense for (M) you must read (B) and then
the sense will be, <em>Meetabel seal, the Son of Matadel</em>; such names
ending in (el) are common in Scripture, as <em>Raphael</em>, <em>Immanuel</em>, and
the like. Let it suffice him who is pleased with neither of those conjectures,
that <em>Hebrew</em> Letters were found there. And though that
Island is remote from the <em>West-Indies</em>, yet it might be by accident
that they might put in thither.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 5.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>That seemes to be to the purpose which <em>Garcillassos de la Voga</em>
saith in his Comment. on <em>Peru</em>, <em>lib.</em> 3. <em>c.</em> 1. <em>That in</em> Tiahuanacu
<em>a Province of</em> Collai, <em>among other Antiquities, this is worthy of
memory</em>, (<em>being scituated at the Lake which the</em> Spaniards <em>call
Chutuytu</em>) <em>That among the great buildings which are there, one
was to be seene of a very great pile, which hath a Court 15. fathoms
broad; a wall that compasseth it, 2 furlongs high; on one
side of the Court is a Chamber 45 foot long, and 22 broad; and
the Court, the Wall, the Pavement, the Chamber, the Roofe of it,
the entrance, the posts of the 2 gates of the Chamber, and of the entrance,
are made only of one stone; the three sides of the Wall are an
ell thick; the</em> Indians say, <em>that that House is dedicated to the
Maker of the World</em>. I conjecture that building to be a Synagogue,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>built by the <em>Israelites</em>; for the Authors who writ about the <em>Indies</em>,
tell us, that the <em>Indians</em> never use Iron, or Iron weapons. Also the
<em>Indians</em> were Idolaters, and therefore it could not be that they should
build an house to God. <em>P. Acosta in lib.</em> 6. <em>Ind. histor.</em> <em>c.</em> 14.
mentions such buildings as are in that place; and he reports that he
measured a stone which was 38. foot long, 18 foot broad, and sixe
foot thick. <em>Petrus Cieza</em> in his first part of his Chronicles of <em>Peru</em>, <em>c.</em>
87. relates, That in the City <em>Guamanga</em>, which is scituated by the river
<em>Vinaque</em>, there is a vast building, which because then it seemed
almost ruined by time, it therefore had lasted many yeares. He asking
the neighbouring <em>Indians</em>, Who built that great Pile? He learnt,
that it was made by a people (who were bearded, and white as the
<em>Spaniards</em>) who came thither a long time before (and staid some
time after) the <em>Indians</em> raigned there; and the <em>Indians</em> said, that
they had received it from their Fathers by Tradition. The same <em>Cieza</em>,
<em>cap.</em> 10. 5. of the Antiquity of <em>Tiguanac</em>, saith, that what the
<em>Indians</em> boast to be very ancient, can by no meanes be compared with
that Ancient building, and other things. From all which you may
well gather, that the first Inhabitants of that place were the <em>Israelites</em>
of the ten Tribes, because they were white, and bearded.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 6.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>To this opinion adde an argument taken from what Logicians
call <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a simili</span></i>; for he that will compare the Lawes and Customes
of the <em>Indians</em> and <em>Hebrewes</em> together, shall finde them agree
in many things; whence you may easily gather, That the <em>Indians</em>
borrowed those of the <em>Hebrewes</em> (who lived among them) before,
or after they went to the unknowne Mountaines. The <em>Indians</em> of
<em>Jucatan</em>, and the <em>Acuzainitenses</em> doe circumcise themselves. The
<em>Totones</em> of <em>New Spaine</em>, and <em>Mexicans</em> (as <em>Roman</em> and <em>Gomaza</em>
in the generall History of the <em>Indians</em> testifie) rend their garments, if
there happen any sudden misfortune or the death of any. <em>Gregorius
Gracias in Monarchia Ingasonum</em>, an Isle of <em>Peru</em>, saith, that
<em>Guainacapacus</em> hearing that his sonne <em>Atagualpa</em> fled for feare of
the Army of his enemy, he rent his garments. The <em>Mexicans</em>, and
<em>Totones</em>, or the <em>Totonacazenses</em> kept continually fire upon their Altars,
as God commands in <em>Leviticus</em>. Those of <em>Peru</em> doe the same,
in their Temples dedicated to the Sun. The <em>Nicaraguazenses</em> doe
forbid their women who were lately brought a bed, to enter their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Temples, till they are purified. The inhabitants of <em>Hispaniola</em> thinke
those doe sin, who lye with a woman a little after her childe-birth.
And the <em>Indians</em> of <em>new Spaine</em> doe severely punish Sodomie. Many
of the <em>Indians</em> doe bury their dead on the Mountaines; which also
is the <em>Jewish</em> custome; and <em>Garcias</em> saith, the name <em>Chanan</em> is found
in those Countries. You may wonder at this, that the <em>Indians</em> doe
every fifty yeares celebrate a Jubilee, with great pomp, in <em>Mexico</em>, the
Metropolis of the whole Province. Also that on the Sabbath day all
are bound to be present in the Temple, to performe their Sacrifices,
and Ceremonies. They also were divorced from their wives, if they
were not honest. The <em>Indians</em> of <em>Peru</em>, <em>New-Spaine</em>, and <em>Guatemala</em>
did marry the Widdowes of their dead Brethren. May not you
judge from these things, that the <em>Jewes</em> lived in those places, and that
the <em>Gentiles</em> learned such things of them? Adde also to what hath
been said, that the knowledge which the <em>Indians</em> had, of the Creation
of the world, and of the universall Flood, they borrowed from the
<em>Israelites</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 7.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The fourth ground of this opinion is, that the <em>Indians</em> are of a
browne colour, and without beards; but in the new world,
white, and bearded men were found, who had never commerce
with the <em>Spaniards</em>; and whom you cannot affirme to be any
other than <em>Israelites</em>; because also as they could never be overcome,
so shall they never be fully knowne, as appeares by what followes.
<em>Petrus Simon</em> a <em>Franciscan</em>, in his History of finding out the firme
Land, saith, that in the reigne of <em>Charles</em> the fifth, he commanded one
called <em>Philippus de Utre</em> thither, to discover, and plant those Countries;
that he found them unknowne toward the North of <em>America</em>
about five degrees, in the Province of <em>Omeguas</em>, which is neare the
Province of <em>Venezuela</em>, and now is called <em>Garracas</em>. And he having
learned of their neighbours, the greatnesse of that people both in
wealth, and in war, he determined to war upon them. Who when
they had marched a good way, at last found a rich City, full of people,
and faire buildings; and not farre off two Husband-men tilling the
ground; whom they would have made Prisoners, that they might
be their interpreters. But when they saw themselves set on, they fled
apace towards the City; but <em>Philippus d’Utre</em> and his Souldiers
followed them hard on Horse-back, and had almost taken them;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>whereupon the Husband-men stood still, and with their Speares
wounded <em>Philip</em> in the breast, piercing through his Brest-plate made
of wooll to keep off Arrowes. He wondering at the dexterity of that
people, judged it a wiser course, not to make war upon that Province,
and people so expert in warre, and who dared to resist armed
men. Therefore he retreated with his Company. And to this day
none goe to that people, neither is it knowne which way to goe to
them. It is probable that they are <em>Israelites</em> whom God preserves
in that place against the day of redemption. <em>Alonsus de Erzilla</em>
testifies the same thing, in 2. part. <em>Sua Araucaniæ.</em> <em>Cant.</em> 27. where
describing those places, he thus speakes in Spanish.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'><em>Ioannes Castilianus Vicarius</em> living in the City <em>Pampelona</em> of
<em>Nova Granada</em> in <em>Peru</em>, saith, that when <em>Gonzalus Pisarrus</em> had
revolted from his people, he sent some to search out new Countries
of the <em>Indians</em> who lived East-ward, whose number could never be
knowne, because that (as some say) their Country is above two
thousand miles in length, if you compute from the head of the river
<em>Maragnon</em>, which runs neare <em>Andes</em> of <em>Cusco</em>, unto the place where
it runs into the Sea, where therefore the River began to be navigable,
<em>Petrus d’Orsna</em> being a Captaine, went by water, and his Souldiers
with him, in Vessels called Canows; which when they were too
small for the force of the streame, he built Brigandines, on the banke of
the River <em>Guariaga</em>, which washing the Province <em>Chachapoyas</em>, runs
into <em>Maragnon</em>. He was scarce gone aboard his Brigandines, when
one of his own Souldiers named <em>Aquirre</em>, a stout man, killed him, who
by common consent succeeded the slaine. When they had gone a
little way, they found a plaine without a mountaine, where many
houses stood on each side of the banke of <em>Maragnon</em>, being built by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the <em>Indians</em>. They still went on for forty eight houres together, and
saw nothing but tall, and white houses, which they feared to goe into,
because the Inhabitants were numerous, and because they heard the
noyse of Hammers; for which cause they thought the Inhabitants to
be Gold-smiths. They went on still, and now sayled in the North
Sea, but alwayes neare to the shoare of the Province of <em>Margareta</em>,
where <em>Aquirre</em> was catcht by the Inhabitants and hanged; for they
heard that he had killed his Captaine <em>Petrus de Orsua</em>.</p>

a new Country.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the yeare 1622. they came to the Province <em>Jarguasongo</em>, which
had been discovered by Captaine <em>Salines</em>; and they passed the Mountaines
<em>Cordilleræ</em>, where the River <em>Maragnon</em> is not above a stones
cast over. In the Province of the <em>Inde Mainenses</em> they built a City,
whose name was St. <em>Franciscus de Borja</em>, at <em>Esquilache</em>. In his company
were one hundred <em>Spaniards</em> in Canows. Having conquered those
<em>Indians</em>, and compelling them to sweare fealty to the King of <em>Spaine</em>;
the Colonell being instructed by the <em>Mainenses</em>, went to other places,
after he had put a Garrison into his new City. Having sailed fifty

there hid themselves) by favour of many Rivers which there run into
<em>Maragnon</em>. When they had sayled into the River <em>Guariaga</em>, where

they asked the <em>Indians</em> whom they had taken (who were
called <em>Guariaga</em>, from the Rivers name) what people doe live on the
Rivers side? they told the Colonell, that five dayes journey off, there
live men of tall stature, comely in presence, and have as great beards
as the <em>Spaniards</em> have, valiant, and warlike, who are not skilled in
Canowes, though the rest of the <em>Indians</em> use no other; he presently

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>In our time, under King <em>Philip</em> the third, Captaine <em>Ferdinades
de Queiros</em> being returned out of <em>India</em> (where he had spent most
of his life) to <em>Rome</em>, he shewed a Table of Lands yet undiscovered.
From thence he went to <em>Madrid</em>, and five ships were given him by
the Governour of <em>Panama</em> (to whom he was sent) to perfect his
designe. He began his journey, and was scarcely entred the South Sea,
but he found Land, which he called, <em>The Isle of Solomon</em>, and <em>Hierusalem</em>,
for reasons which he told me. He in his course of sayling alwayes
kept close to the shoare of those Islands; he saw those Islanders
of a browne colour, and took many; others dwelt in greater Islands,
and more fruitfull; these were white, and wore long garments
of silk; and the Pilot being bid to bring his Ship neare the shoare, he
split his Ship upon a Rock, (and the Islanders running greedily to the
sight) which being sunke, the Captaine went thence, looking for the
firme Land, which he found to be forty degrees beyond; and he went
three hundred miles neare the shoare; and<a id='t26'></a> when he perceived the
Country to be inhabited by the smoke which he saw, and would put
into a Port on the side of the River, there ran to him many white men,
of yellow haire, tall like Giants, richly cloathed, and of long beards.
But one of the Vessels being wracked in the Havens mouth, he was
forced to put out to Sea; whereupon the Islanders sent two Chaloffi
of a browne colour, (as the inhabitants were of the first Island)
with sheep, and other provisions, and fruits, but desiring, and threatning
them, if they did not depart: The Captaine brought those Chaloffi
into <em>Spaine</em>, from whom the <em>Spaniards</em> could learne nothing but
by signes; and instead of answers, (when they were asked) would
shew their beards, as if such those were, who were their Lords, and
had sent them, and if they were asked about Religion, they would
hold up their fingers to Heaven, implying, that they worshipped but
one God. A little while after, they dyed in <em>Spaine</em>. The Captaine returned
to <em>Panama</em>, having left his two Ships which were wracked;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>and when the Governour sued him, by meanes of the Senators, who
are over the <em>Indian</em> affaires, he was dismissed, and returned with his
Ships into <em>Spaine</em>, where he abode two yeares before his matters were
dispatched. But the King created him Marquesse of the Countries
found out by him, and commanded to give him a good Army,
where-with to compasse his designes. But he scarce got to <em>Panama</em>,
when he dyed, not without suspition of being poysoned by the Governour.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 12.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>That which I am about to tell, shall serve for a proofe of that
which I said of the <em>West-Indians</em>. A Dutch Mariner told
me, that not long since he was with his ship in <em>America</em>, seven degrees
towards the North between <em>Maragnon</em>, and great <em>Para</em>, and
he put into an Harbour in a pleasant River, where he found some <em>Indians</em>
who understood <em>Spanish</em>, of whom he bought Meats, and Dywood;
after he had stayed there six moneths, he understood that that
River extended eighteen leagues towards the <em>Carybes Indians</em>, as far
as the ship could goe; and that the River is divided there into three
branches, and they sayling two months on the left hand, there met
them white men, and bearded, well bred, well cloathed, and abounding
with gold and silver; they dwelt in Cities enclosed with wals,
and full of people; and that some <em>Indians</em> of <em>Oronoch</em> went thither,
and brought home much gold, silver, and many precious stones,
Which he having understood, sent thither some Sea-men; but the
<em>Indian</em> dyed by the way, who was their guide, and so they did not
proceed, but stayed there two months, and trucked with the <em>Indians</em>
who were sixty leagues from Sea. That Province is called <em>Jisbia</em>, and
is subject to <em>Zealand</em>; they have no commerce with the <em>Spaniards</em>,
and the inhabitants travell securely every way. I heard that story
by accident from that <em>Dutch</em> Master of the Ship; whence some of
us guessing them to be <em>Israelites</em>, had purposed to send him againe
to enquire more fully. But he dyed suddenly the last yeare, whence
it seemes that God doth not permit that those purposes should take
any effect till the end of dayes.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 13.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Yet I give more credit to our <em>Montezinus</em>, being a <em>Portingal</em>,
and a <em>Jew</em> of our Order; borne in a City of <em>Portingal</em>, called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span><em>Villefleur</em>, of honest and known Parents, a man about forty yeares
old, honest, and not ambitious. He went to the <em>Indies</em>, where he was
put into the Inquisition, as the successor of many who were borne in
<em>Portingal</em>, and descended from them, whom the King of <em>Portingal</em>,
<em>Don Manuel</em> forced to turne Christians: (<em>O wicked, and unjust
action</em>, saith <em>Osorius</em>; and a little after, <em>This was done neither according
to Law, nor Religion</em>,) and yet to this day they privately
keep their Religion, which they had changed, being forced thereto.
He being freed from the Inquisition, very diligently sought out these
things, and oft spoke with those men, and then was not quiet till he
came hither, and had told us that good newes. He endured much in
that journey, and was driven to great want, so that no house would
give him food, or give him money for his worke. I my selfe was well
acquainted with him for six months together that he lived here; and
sometimes I made him take an Oath in the presence of honest men,
that what he had told, was true. Then he went to <em>Farnambuc</em>, where
two yeares after he dyed, taking the same Oath at his death. Which
if it be so, why should not I beleeve a man that was vertuous, and having
all that which men call gaine. And who knowes but that shortly
the truth of that Prognostick may appeare, which our <em>Montezinus</em>
learned from the <em>Mohanes</em>; answerable to that which <em>Jacobus Verus</em>
an Astrologer of <em>Prague</em> writ after the apparition of the Comet in
<em>Ann.</em> 1618. and dedicated to his Highnesse the Prince <em>Palatine</em>,
where he thus discourseth: The Comet going towards the South,
doth intimate that the Cities and Provinces which God doth threaten,
are those of the <em>West-Indies</em>, which shall revolt from the King of
<em>Spaine</em>, who will finde that losse greater then he imagined, not that the
<em>Indians</em> rebell against him of themselves, but that they are provoked
to it being stirred up by others. Neither did the Comet only fore-tell
that, but the eclipse of the Sun, which was in that Country the yeare
before. Thus far the Astrologer. Our ancient Rabbins say, though
we doe not beleeve the Astrologers in all things, yet we doe not
wholly reject them, who sometimes tell truth.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 15.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>You must know that all the ten Tribes were not carried away at
the same time. <em>Pul</em> the King of <em>Assyria</em> (as I shew in the second

of <em>Reuben</em>, <em>Gad</em>, and halfe <em>Manasseh</em>, in the reigne of <em>Peka</em>, as you

away. <em>Hoshea</em>, with the rest of the Tribes, in <em>2 King.</em> 17.6. Of those
three times the Prophet <em>Isaiah</em> speakes, <em>Isa.</em> 9.1. saying, the first

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The ten Tribes being conquered at severall times, we must
thinke they were carried into severall places. As we beleeve
they went to the <em>West-Indies</em> by the strait of <em>Anian</em>, so we
thinke that out of <em>Tartary</em> they went to <em>China</em>, by that famous wall
in the confines of both. Our argument to prove it, is taken from the
authority of two Jesuites, who erected their Colledges in those Countries.
<em>Nicholaus Trigantius</em> a Dutch-man in his discourse of the
Christian expedition under-taken by the Jesuites to <em>Sina</em>, saith, We
finde that in former time the <em>Jewes</em> came into these Kingdomes. And
when that society had for some yeares seated it selfe in the Court of
the <em>Pequinenses</em>, a certaine <em>Jew</em> came to <em>P. Matthæus Riccius</em>; he
was borne in <em>Chamfamfu</em> the metropolis of the Province <em>Honan</em>, and
was surnamed <em>Ogay</em>; and now being licensed to the degree of a Doctor,
he went to <em>Pequin</em>. But when he read in a certaine Booke writ
by a Doctor of <em>China</em>, concerning the <em>European</em> affaires, That our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>fathers are not <em>Sarazens</em>, and know no God but the Lord of Heaven
and Earth; and would perswade himselfe that ours did professe the
Law of <em>Moses</em>, he went into the Church with <em>P. Matthæas Riccius</em>.
On an Altar there was the effigies of the Virgin <em>Mary</em>, and the
childe Jesus, whom St. <em>John</em> his fore-runner worshipped with bended
knees; now that day was the Holy-day of <em>John</em> the Baptist. The
<em>Jew</em> thinking it was the effigies of <em>Rebecca</em>, and her two Sons, <em>Jacob</em>
and <em>Esau</em>, he bowed also to the Image, but with this Apology, that
he worshipped no Images, but that he could not but honour these
who were the Parents of our Nation. And he asking if the foure Evangelists
on both sides of the Altar, were not foure of the twelve
sons of <em>Jacob</em>; the Jesuite answered, Yes, thinking he had asked of
the twelve Apostles. But afterward the <em>Jew</em> acknowledged to the
Jesuite that he was an <em>Israelite</em>; and he found the Kings Bible, and
acknowledged the <em>Hebrew</em> Letters, though he could not read them.
By this occasion our people learnt, that ten or twelve families of <em>Israelites</em>
were there, and had built a very neat Synagogue which cost
ten thousand Crownes, in which they have kept the five Bookes of
<em>Moses</em> with great veneration for six hundred yeares. He also affirmed,
that in <em>Hamcheu</em> the Metropolis of the Province <em>Chequiona</em>,
there are farre more Families, with a Synagogue; and else-where that
many Families live without a Synagogue, because that by little and
little they are extinguished. He relating many things out of the Old
Testament, he differed but little in pronouncing those names. He
said, that some among them were not ignorant of the <em>Hebrew</em>
Tongue, but that himselfe had neglected it, having studied the <em>China</em>
Tongue from a Childe. For which cause he was counted almost unworthy
of their society, by the Ruler of the Synagogue. But he chiefly
looked after this, that he might get to be Doctor. Three yeares after
<em>P. Matthæus Riccius</em> sent one of our brethren to that Metropolis,
who found all those things true. He compared the beginnings, and
endings of the Bookes which the <em>Jewes</em> keep in their Synagogue,
with our Pentateuch, and saw no difference, this only, that those had
no pricks. The other Jesuite is <em>Alfonsus Cimedro</em>, who likewise
saith, that there is a great number of <em>Jewes</em> in the Province of <em>Oroensis</em>,
on the West part of <em>China</em>, who know nothing of the comming,
and suffering of Jesus. And he from thence gathers, that they are of
the ten Tribes, (which opinion I also am of) because those <em>Chineses</em>
observe many <em>Jewish</em> Rites, which you may see in a manuscript, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the noble <em>Jaochimus Wicofortius</em> hath. And why might not some of
them saile from <em>China</em> to <em>New-Spaine</em>, through the streight between
<em>China</em>, and <em>Anian</em>, and <em>Quivira</em>, which doe border upon <em>New-Spaine</em>;
and from thence they went to the Isles of <em>Panama</em>, <em>Peru</em>,
and those thereabouts. These in my judgement are those <em>Chineses</em> of
whom <em>Isaiah</em> speakes, Chap. 49. vers. 12. (treating about <em>Israels</em>
returne to his Country.) <em>Behold, these shall come from afarre, and
these from the North, and from the West, and these from the
Land of Sinim.</em> And so <em>Ptolomy</em> in <em>lib.</em> 7. <em>c.</em> 3. <em>tab.</em> 11. cals it The
country of <em>Sinim</em>, or <em>Sina</em>; and this is the true sense of the words;
<em>Aben Ezra</em> therefore is mistaken, who derives it of Sene, a bush or
wood, which he placeth in <em>Ægypt</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 17.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>I Could easily beleeve, that the ten Tribes as they increased in number,
so they spread into more Provinces before-mentioned, and
into <em>Tartary</em>. For <em>Abraham Ortelius</em> in his Geography of the
World, and Map of <em>Tartary</em>, he notes the place of the <em>Danites</em> which
he cals the Hord, which is the same which the Hebrew <em>Jerida</em>, signifying
<em>A descent</em>. And lower, he mentions the Hord of <em>Naphtali</em>,
possessed by <em>Peroza</em> in the yeare 476. <em>Schikhardus</em> in his Tarich or
series of the Kings of <em>Persia</em>, amplifies the History of this War, where
<em>ex lib. 4. of Agathias</em>, he thus saith, <em>A little after, when they
were eased of that Plague</em>, (<em>sc.</em> 7. yeares drought) <em>in the time of
the Emperour</em> Zeno, Firuz <em>made a double warre with</em> Naphtali, <em>in
which at last he was destroyed. For first of all he was brought to the
streights of places unknowne; who then sought for peace upon this
condition (and obtained it) that he should sweare that he would
never after provoke them; and that he should doe reverence to this
Conquerour in token of subjection: which afterward by the counsell
of the Magicians he performed craftily, for he bowed towards
the Eastern Sun, that his owne people might thinke that he bowed
rather to the Sun (after his Country custom) then to honour his
Enemy. But he did not truly performe that first agreement, though
confirmed by Letters Patents; who because he could not digest the
disgrace of bowing to his Enemy, he prepared a new Army and
went against them; but a second time he being entrapped by the
badnesse of the Country, he lost his life; and many with him, in a
Gulf which the</em> Naphthalites <em>had prepared for him, having dressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>it over with reeds, and some earth throwne a top; they having left
in the middle some high grounds, and trees where their Scouts
were, that their stratagem might not be found, and that the</em> Persians
<em>might more confidently attempt the ditch. Thus a rash King
paid for his perfidy, he excelling more in daring, then in counsell,
as</em> Agathias <em>saith. The patent by which peace had been agreed, was
hung upon a speare, and might be seene of him at distance, that he
might remember his Oath, repent, and desist from his enterprise;
but he cared little for that. But when by his unexpected fall he
saw he should dye, it is said that he pulled off from his right eare a
pearle of huge bignesse, and whitenesse, and least any after him
should finde it (more likely that his corps should not be knowne) he
threw it a great way off.</em> The same Author askes, who those <em>Naphthalites</em>
were, and by many arguments he proves that they are the relicks
of the <em>Jewes</em>; saith he, <em>I doe wholly thinke that they are the
relicks of the</em> Jewes <em>of the Tribe of</em> Naphtali, <em>whom</em> Triglath Pilesser
<em>the</em> Assyrian <em>carried into those places, in</em> 2 King. 15.29. <em>For</em> 1. <em>The
name, in the best copies of</em> Agathias, <em>which</em> Lewenclavius <em>hath
mended, is the same fully; in other Bookes it wants nothing but an
(h) now it is scarce possible that in a word of many syllables that
should fall out by chance</em>. 2. <em>Their countenance discovers it, for
as Procopious</em> I. C. <em>saith, they are not blacke, or foule in their
countenance, as the</em> Auns <em>are among whom they live, but the only
white men of that Country; that it may evidently appeare that
they came from some other place thither</em>. 3. <em>Their manners agree,
for the same Author saith, that they are not</em> Nomades, <em>as
the</em> Huns <em>who are unconstant in their dwelling, and eate up one place
after another; but they inhabite one certaine place. Besides, they
observe Law and equity, as the</em> Romans; <em>and have pollicy, being
well governed by their Prince: both which is rare among their
neighbour Nations. Also they doe not lay abroad their dead, as
the</em> Barbarians <em>doe, but they decently cover them with earth. Lastly,
their jornalls doe testifie that many</em> Jewes <em>live there, especially
in the mountaines, who have searched to the mid-land countries of
East</em>-Asia, R. Benjamin, <em>f.</em> 23. <em>From thence</em> (<em>the coast of</em> Persia)
<em>is 28. dayes journey to the mountaines</em> Nisebor, <em>which are neare the
river</em> Gozan. <em>The Israelites which come from thence into</em> Persia,
<em>say, that there in the Cities of</em> Nisebor, <em>are four Tribes</em> (<em>sc.</em> Dan,
Zebulon, Asor, Naphtali,) <em>of the first captivity, which</em> Shalmaneser
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span><em>the</em> Assyrian <em>carried thither, as in</em> 2 King. 17.6. <em>he brought them
to</em> Habor, <em>and</em> Halah, <em>the river</em> Gozan <em>and the Mountaines of</em>
Media. <em>The compasse of that Country is twenty dayes journey; and
they possesse Cities, and Castles upon the Mountaines, by one side
of which, runs the river</em> Gozan; <em>neither are they subject to the
Nations, but have a Governour over them, by name</em> R. Joseph
Amarkela <em>a Levite, and there are among them some who study
wisdome. They sow, and reap; yea they wage war to the Country
of</em> Cuth. <em>In</em> the same place <em>Ortelius</em> adds, in the Country <em>Tabor</em>,
or <em>Tibur</em> (which <em>Solinus</em> commends, in <em>c.</em> 49.) they dwell a
people, who though they have lost the holy writings, they obey
one King, who came into <em>France</em>, in Ann. 1530. and spoke with
<em>Francis</em> the first, was burnt at <em>Mantua</em> by the command of the
Emperour <em>Charles</em> the fifth, because that he did privately teach
Judaism to Christian Princes, and to the Emperour himselfe. <em>Boterus</em>
saith the same in his relations of the farthest part of <em>Tartary</em>.
But both these were deceived; for <em>Rabbinus Josephus Cohon</em>, a
man worthy to be beleeved, relates this more truly in his Chronology,
saying, that the <em>Jew</em> who came out of that Country, was the
brother of the King of the <em>Israelites</em>, was called <em>David</em> the <em>Reubenite</em>;
and having seene <em>India</em> in his passage, he came to <em>Portugal</em>,
where he converted the Kings Secretary to Judaism, who fled from
thence with him, taking the name of <em>Selomoh Molho</em>; he in
short time was so well versed in the Law, yea in the <em>Cabala</em> it selfe,
that he made all <em>Italy</em> admire him. The Secretary together with the
<em>Reubenite</em>, endevoured to draw the Pope, <em>Charles</em> the fifth, and
<em>Francis</em> the first to Judaism. <em>Selomoh Molho</em> was taken at <em>Mantua</em>,
and burnt alive, in the yeare 1540. He yet was offered his life, if
he would turne Christian. The <em>Reubenite</em> was by <em>Charles</em> the fifth
carried prisoner into <em>Spaine</em>, where he shortly after dyed. <em>Abraham
Frisol Orchotolam</em> remembers the <em>Reubenite</em>, saying, Forty five years
agone <em>David Reubenita</em>, a Prince of the <em>Israelites</em>, came from <em>Tabor</em>,
a Province of <em>Tartary</em>, into <em>Europe</em>, who said that two Tribes
are there; and other Tribes a little farther, under their Kings, and
Princes, and also an unspeakable number of people. Perhaps the Province
<em>Tabor</em> is the same that <em>Habor</em>; which is mentioned in 2 King.
17.6. that the ten Tribes were brought by <em>Salmaneser</em> to <em>Habor</em>,
and <em>Halah</em>; now the Hebrew letters (<em>h</em>) and (<em>t</em>) are neere in fashion.
<em>Eldad Danita</em> of the Tribe of <em>Dan</em>, came out of those Countries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>five hundred yeares agone (a letter from whom, which we call
<em>Sephar Eldad Danita</em>, is kept to this day) and being examined by
the Rabbins, was found an approved man. The learned Rabbi <em>David
Kimhi</em>, who lived 450. yeares since, in <em>etymol. suo</em> in the word <em>Segiah</em>,
he saith, <em>Rabbi Jonah</em> writes of the name of <em>Rabbi Juda Aben
Karis</em>, that he heard <em>Eldad Danita</em> say, &amp;c. And so what I said is
true, as appeares by the testimonies produced.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 18.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Part of the ten Tribes also live in <em>Ethiopia</em>, in the <em>Habyssin</em> Kingdome;
as divers <em>Habyssins</em> reported at <em>Rome</em>. <em>Boterus</em> in his relations
speakes the same thing, that two potent Nations doe live neare
<em>Nilus</em>, and that one of them is that of the <em>Israelites</em>, who are governed
by a mighty King. A Cosmographer who hath added notes to
<em>Ptolomyes</em> tables, saith thus in his table of <em>New Africa</em>; that part
of <em>New Africk</em> was unknowne of old, the head of <em>Nilus</em> not being
knowne, which is in the Mountaines of the Moone, as the Ancients
call them; where there dwels a great number of <em>Israelites</em>, paying
tribute to <em>Prester John</em>. <em>Rabbi Abraham Frisol</em> in the Book already
quoted, saith, that in his time some who had been in those Countries,
reported the same to <em>Hercules</em> the Duke of <em>Ferraria</em>. And without
question from hence the <em>Habyssins</em> learned Circumcision, the observation
of the Sabbath, and many more <em>Jewish</em> rites. Of these <em>Isaiah</em>
seemes to speake, in <em>Isa.</em> 18.1, 2. <em>Woe to the Land which under
the shadow of sails doth saile beyond the rivers of</em> Ethiopia, <em>by
whom</em> (the Prophet saith) <em>are sent Ambassadors in ships of Bulrushes</em>,
(such as the <em>Æthiopians</em> use, commonly called <em>Almadiæ</em>.)
<em>Bring back a people driven out of their Country, and torn, and
more miserable then any among us. Gifts shal be brought to the Lord
of Sebaoth, in the place where the name of the Lord of Sebaoth is
worshipped, in the mount Sion.</em> The Prophet <em>Zephany</em> saith the same,
in <em>Zeph.</em> 3.9, 10. <em>Then will I give to the people that they speaking
a pure language, may all call upon the name of God, whom they
shall serve with reverence; from beyond the rivers of</em> Ethiopia <em>they
shall bring to me for a gift, Hatray</em> the daughter of my dispersed
ones, (that is, the Nations of <em>Æthiopia</em>.) Which agrees with that
of <em>Isa.</em> <em>And your Brethren</em>, (which are the ten Tribes) <em>shall bring
gifts to the Lord</em>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>And without doubt they also dwell in <em>Media</em>; from thence they
passed <em>Euphrates</em>, whither they were first brought, as in <em>2 King.</em>
17.24 and in the book of <cite>Tobit</cite>. <em>Josephus</em> also speakes of them in
the Preface of his Book of the War of the <em>Jewes</em>, that the <em>Jewes</em> did
think that their brethren, who dwelt beyond <em>Euphrates</em>, and farther,
would rebell against the Romans. <em>Agrippa</em> in his Oration to the
people of <em>Jerusalem</em>, that they would not rebell against the <em>Romans</em>,
speakes thus; <em>What associates doe ye expect to joyne with you in
your rebellion, and war? doth not all the knowne world pay tribute
to the</em> Romans? <em>Perhaps some of ye hope to have help from them
beyond</em> Euphrates. And in <em>lib.</em> 2. <em>Antiquit.</em> <em>c.</em> 5. speaking of those
who in the time of <em>Ezra</em> returned from <em>Babylon</em> to <em>Jerusalem</em>, he
saith, <em>All Israel dwelt in</em> Media; <em>for two Tribes only dwelt in</em> Asia,
<em>and</em> Europe, <em>and lived subject to the</em> Romans; <em>as the other ten
on the other side</em> Euphrates, <em>where they are so many, that they cannot
be counted</em>. It is not therefore to be doubted, the people encreasing
after their first transportation, they sought out new places, which
we have formerly mentioned.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 20.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Lastly, all thinke, that part of the ten Tribes dwell beyond the river
<em>Sabbathian</em>, or sabbaticall. <em>Rabbi Johanan</em> the Author of
the <em>Jerusalem Talmud</em>, who lived 160. yeares after the destruction
of the second Temple, saith in his treatise of the <em>Sanhedrim</em>, <em>cap.</em> 17.
That the ten Tribes were carryed into three places, <em>sc.</em> to the Sabbaticall
river, to <em>Daphne</em> the suburbs of <em>Antioch</em>, and thither where a
cloud comes downe and covers them: And that they shall be redeemed
from those three places; for so he opens that place of <em>Isa.</em> Cha.
49.9. <em>That they may say to the Captives, Goe forth</em>, (<em>sc.</em> to them
who are at the Sabbaticall river) <em>to them that are in darknesse, shew
your selves</em>, (<em>sc.</em> to them who are compassed with the cloud) <em>and to
all, they shall be refreshed in the wayes</em>, (<em>sc.</em> to them who live in
<em>Daphne</em> of <em>Antioch</em> which is in <em>Syria</em>.) Whence you may observe,
that the learned man <em>l’ Empereur</em> translated it ill, <em>at the sides of
Antioch</em>, whereas <em>Daphne</em> is the proper name of a pleasant Grove near
<em>Antioch</em>. <em>Sedar olam</em> makes mention of that cloud, and calls them
<em>mountaines of obscurity</em>, And in <em>Talmud tractat. Sanhedr.</em> <em>c.</em> 11.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span><em>R. Jonathan ben Uziel</em>, who lived a hundred yeares before the destruction
of the second Temple, in <em>Exod.</em> 34.10. where the Lord
saith, <em>I will doe wonders before all thy people, such as was never
done in the whole earth, or in any Nation</em>, &amp;c. and he refers all those
things to the transportation of the people. <em>He shall draw them to
the rivers of Babylon: and shall carry them to the Sabbaticall river,
and shall teach them, that those miracles were never performed
to any Nation of the known world.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Our ancient Rabins in<a id='t36'></a> <em>Beresit Rabba</em> (no mean book) in <cite>Perasach</cite>,
do say that <em>Tornunsus</em> asking how it should appeare that the day
which we keep, is the seventh day, on which God rested after the creation
of the world; <em>Rabbi Aquebah</em> (who lived 52 yeares after the
destruction of the second Temple) answered by an argument taken from
the stones of the Sabbatical River, which in the six dayes are tossed
up and down with a continuall motion, but do rest on the Sabbath day
and move not. The same is said in the <em>Babylonian Talmud, tractat.
Sanhed. c.</em> 7. <em>&amp; in Tanuh Perasach. c.</em> 9. <em>In eodem Beresit Raba, in
Perasach</em> 37. <em>Rabbi Simon</em> saith, <em>The ten Tribes were carried to the
Sabbaticall river but Juda and Benjamin are dispersed into all Countrys</em>.
In <em>Asirim Raba</em>, the last verse of the Song, its said, <em>Our bed
is flourishing</em>; that it is meant the ten Tribes, which were carryed
to the Sabbaticall river; and that river running all the week, doth
cause the ten Tribes there remaining to be shut up; for though on the
seventh day the river doth rest, yet it is forbidden by our Law to take
a journey then; and for that reason they remained there miraculously,
as lost, and concealed from us. So that of <em>Isa.</em> 49. <em>That they say to
the prisoners, go forth</em>, is interpreted of them in <em>Jalcut</em>. <em>R. Aquebah</em>
after the same manner explains that of <em>Levit.</em> 36.38. <em>And ye shal
perish among the heathen.</em> And that of <em>Isa.</em> 27. <em>ult.</em> <em>And they shall
come, who were ready to perish in Assyria.</em> Because they are remote
from the rest, therefore another Rabbi in Bamibar <em>Raba
Parasa</em> 16. applyes to them that of <em>Isaiah</em> 49.12. <em>Behold them
who come from farre</em>: that so all those Authors mention that
River.</p>

<p class='c007'>The testimony of <em>Josephus</em> is famous, <em>lib.</em> 7. <em>de Bel. Jud. cap.</em> 24.
saying, <em>The Emperour Titus passing between Arca, and Raphanea,
Cities of King Agrippa, he saw the wonderfull river, which though
it be swift, yet it is dry on every seventh day; and that day being
past, it resumes its ordinary course, as if it had no change; and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>always observes this order. It is called Sabbaticall; from the
solemne feast of the Jews, because it imitates their rest every
seventh day.</em> I know some do otherwise expound those words of <em>Josephus</em>,
but they hit not his meaning, as appears by this, that he calls
the River, Sabbathio, or sabbaticall: which word cannot be derived
but from Sabbath; and who doth not see that it ceaseth to flow, or
move, on the Sabbath day; and so <em>Josephus</em> must be understood according
to my sense. <em>Pliny</em> also confirms this opinion, <em>lib.</em> 1. <em>Nat. hist.
c.</em> 2. he saith, <em>In Judea a River lies dry every Sabbath</em>; yet I think
<em>Pliny</em> is deceived and ill informed, when he saith it is a River in Judea;
neither is to be found in Judea, but in another place, where many
Jewes live. <em>R. Selomoh Jarchi</em> who lived 540. years since mentions
that River in <em>Comment. Talm.</em> saying, The stones, and sand of
that River do continually move all the six dayes of the week, until the
seventh. <em>R. Mardochus Japhe</em> in his learned book <cite>Jephe Thoar</cite>
saith, The <em>Arabians</em> derive Sabbathion from the Sabbath, who use
to adde the particle<a id='t37'></a> (ion) to adjectives. The same saith, that it was
told him of an hour-glasse filled with the sand of Sabbathion, which
ranne all the weeke till the Sabbath. And I heard the same from
my father; which testimony I account as good, as if I saw it my selfe;
(for fathers do not use to impose upon their sons.) He told me that
there was an Arabian at <em>Lisborn</em>, who had such an hour-glasse; and
that every Friday at evening he would walk in the street called the new
street, and shew this glasse to Jewes who counterfeited Christianity,
and say, <em>Ye Jewes, shut up your shops, for now the Sabbath comes</em>.
Another worthy of credit, told me of another hour-glasse, which he
had some years before, before the Port <em>Mysketa</em>. The Cadi, or Judge
of that place, saw him by chance passing that way, and asked him,
what it was? he commanded it to be taken away; rebuking the Mahomitans,
that by this, they did confirme the Jewish Sabbath. I
should not speak of these glasses, if the authority of such a man whom
I have alledged, did not move me; though I beleeve that God did
not only work that miracle, that he might keep part of the ten Tribes
there, but other also, as you may see in <em>Esdras</em>. <em>R. Moses Gerundensis</em>
a learned Cabalist, and Interpreter of the Law in <em>Parasa Aazinu</em>,
thinks the River Sabbathion to be the same with Gozan, of Guz, which
signifies to snatch away, because except the seventh day, on all the
other, it carryes with it, by its swiftnesse, the very stones. Of this
there is mention in 2 <em>King.</em> whither the King of <em>Assyria</em> led his captives;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>and so relates <em>Benjamin Tudelensis</em> in his journall, that part
of the ten Tribes dwelt at the bank of that River. But I know not
where the River Gozan is. In the year 5394, that is, 15 years agon in
the City <em>Lubin</em>, two <em>Polonians</em> after they had travelled long, they wrot
in Dutch a book of the originiall of the Sabbaticall River, but the Senate
commanded it to be burnt at the Mart of Breslaw, by the perswasion
of the Jesuites. <em>Abraham Frisal</em> in his Orchot Olam. <em>c.</em> 26.
will have this river to be in <em>India</em>, he saith, <em>The head of the Sabbaticall
river is in the country of Upper India, among the rivers
of Ganges</em>. And a little after, <em>The Sabbaticall river hath its originall
from the other side of Kalikout</em> (which lyes far above the bound
of <em>Lamik</em>, which he placeth beyond the <em>sinus Barbaricus</em>) <em>and it parts
the Indians from the Kingdome of the Jewes, which river you may
certainly find there</em>, Though he takes <em>Gozan</em> for <em>Ganges</em>, for some
nearnesse of writing; yet its not to be doubted that in that place there
are many Jewes, witnesse <em>Johannes de Bairos</em> in his Decads. <em>Eldad
Danita</em> speaking of the four Tribes: which he placeth at <em>Gozan</em> saith,
<em>The Sabbaticall river is among them</em>. <em>Josephus</em> saith, that <em>Titus</em>
saw the Sabbathion between <em>Arca</em> and <em>Raphanea</em>. Which testimony
seems the truer, because its not to be thought that <em>Josephus</em> would tel a
lie of him, by whom he might be rebuked. I think that ye must look
for it not far from the Caspian Sea: and I am not alone in this opinion.
What ever it be it appeares that this river is somewhere, and
that part of the ten Tribes are hid there; and I may say with <em>Moses</em>
in <em>Deut.</em> 29.28, 29. <em>And the Lord cast them out of their Land in
anger, and in wrath; Secret things belong to the Lord our God.</em>
For it is not known when they shall return to their Countrey; neither
can it perfectly be shewed where they are, God suffering it, as its said
in <em>Deut.</em> 32.26. <em>I determined to cast them forth unto the ends of
the earth, and to make their remembrance cease from among men.</em>
As if he should say, I wil cast them unto the furthest places of the world
that none may remember them; and therefore they are truly in Scripture
called <em>imprisoned</em>, and <em>lost</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT.</em> 21.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Neither is there weight in the Argument which some have
brought to me, if they be in the world, why doe we not know
them better? There are many things which we know, and yet know not
their original; are we not to this day ignorant of the heads of the four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Rivers, <em>Nilus</em>, <em>Ganges</em>, <em>Euphrates</em>, and <em>Tegris</em>? also there are many
unknown Countryes. Besides, though some live in knowne and neighbour
Countrys, yet they are unknown by being behind Mountains;
so it happened under the reign of <em>Ferdinand</em>, and <em>Isabel</em>, that some
Spaniards were found out by accident, at <em>Batueca</em>, belonging to the
Duke of <em>Alva</em>, which place is distant but ten miles from <em>Salamanca</em>,
and near to <em>Placentia</em>, whither some Spaniards fled, when the <em>Moors</em>
possessed <em>Spaine</em>, and dwelt there 800 years. If therefore a people
could lie hid so long in the middle of <em>Spaine</em>, why may we not say
that those are hid, whom God will not have any perfectly to know,
before the end of days?</p>

<p class='c007'>And these things we have gathered concerning the habitations of
the ten Tribes, who, we beleeve, do still keep the Jewish Rites, as in
2 <em>King.</em> 17.26. when the Israelites were carryed captive by <em>Salmaneser</em>,
and those of <em>Cuthah</em> came in their stead, an Israelitish Priest
was sent by the King, to teach them, because Lyons infested them, for
that they were ignorant that there was another worship used in the
land: but when the Priest saw that it was impossible to take that people
wholly off from Idolatry, he permitted them to worship divers gods, so
that they would acknowledge one, to be the mover of all things. The
same is also sufficiently proved out of all the Histories which we have
alledged. And our brethren do keep the law more zealously out of their
land, then in it, as being neither ambitious, nor contentious (which
hath sometimes happened with the family of <em>David</em>) by which means
they might easily erre in the true Religion, not acknowledge <em>Jerusalem</em>,
and withdraw that obedience, which is due to the Lord, and
to his Temple.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT.</em> 22.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Wee learne out of the first of <em>Ezra</em>, that none of the ten Tribes
entred the second Temple; for it is said that only some of the
Tribe of <em>Judah</em>, and some of <em>Benjamin</em> did returne. <em>Ezra</em> also saith
the same in the first of <em>Chronicles</em>, that <em>Salmaneser</em> carryed the ten
Tribes to <em>Hala</em>, <em>Habor</em>, and <em>Hara</em>, and to the river <em>Gozan</em> to this day:
so that you may gather that at that time they were there. So likewise
<em>Josephus in Antiq; Ind. lib.</em> 11. <em>c.</em> 5.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps some will say, since <em>Media</em> and <em>Persia</em>, are near to <em>Babylon</em>,
why did they not return to <em>Jerusalem</em> with the two Tribes? I
answer, because so few of the two neighbouring Tribes did return from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>thence to <em>Jerusalem</em>, for that they were wel seated in <em>Babylon</em>; or else
because they heard the Prophets say, that they must not look for any
redemption but that which was to be at the end of dayes. How then
can we thinke that they who were more remote, and also had learnt
the same things of the Prophets, should leave their place, perhaps to
suffer new miseries, and calamities? Besides, we doe not read that
<em>Cyrus</em> gave leave to any to return, but only to the two Tribes of <em>Juda</em>
and <em>Benjamin</em>. And also it is probable (as some Authors affirme)
that they could not goe up from thence, because they had continually
Wars with the neighbour people.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT.</em> 23.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Hitherto we have shewed that the ten Tribes are in divers places,
as in the <em>West-Indies</em>, in <em>Sina</em>; in the confines of <em>Tartary</em>, beyond
the river <em>Sabbathion</em>, and <em>Euphrates</em>, in <em>Media</em>, in the Kingdome
of the <em>Habyssins</em>; of all which the Prophet <em>Isaiah</em> is to be
understood, in <em>Isa.</em> 11.11. <em>It shall come to passe in that day, that
the Lord shall set his hand the second time to recover the remnant
of his people, which shall be left from</em> Assyria, <em>from</em> Egypt, <em>from</em>
Pathros, <em>from</em> Ethiopia, <em>from</em> Elam, <em>from</em> Sinear, <em>from</em> Hamath, <em>and
from the Islands of the Sea</em>. From whence you may gather, that it
is meant of those places where the ten Tribes dwell. <em>Syria</em> and <em>Ægypt</em>
shall be the two places of their generall meeting; as more fully
hereafter.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Pathros</em>, is not <em>Pelusium</em>, nor <em>Petra</em>, but <em>Parthia</em>, neare to the
Caspian Sea, where I thinke, with many others, the Sabbaticall river
is. Although there is a <em>Pathros</em> in <em>Ægypt</em>, as the learned <em>Samuel
Bochardus</em> saith in his holy Geography.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Chus</em>, according to common opinion, is <em>Æthiopia</em>, as is proved
out of <em>Jer.</em> 13.23. and in this place of <em>Jeremy</em> are meant the <em>Israelites</em>,
who live in the Country of the <em>Abyssins</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Elam</em>, is a Province in <em>Persia</em>, as it appeares in <em>Dan.</em> 8.2.
where are desert places, in which, perhaps, the remnant of the ten
Tribes is.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Shinar</em>, is a Province about <em>Babylon</em>, as in <em>Gen.</em> 10.10. where
<em>Babel</em> is said to be in <em>Shinar</em>; and <em>Dan.</em> 1.2. it is said, that <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em>
carryed the holy Vessels to the Land of <em>Shinar</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Hamath</em>, there are many Hamaths mentioned in the Scripture, many
understand it of <em>Antioch</em>; but because Geographers reckon up 12
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>places named <em>Antioch</em>, therefore we can affirme nothing for certain;
but I thinke, that that is meant, which is placed in <em>Sythia</em>. The seventy
Interpreters by <em>Hamath</em>, understand the Sun, from <em>Hamath</em>
the Sun; and they translate it, From the rising of the Sun; and I
thinke it is no ill translation; for hereby all the <em>Israelites</em> who are in
greater <em>Asia</em>, <em>India</em>, and <em>Sina</em>, may be understood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Islands of the Sea</em>; so almost all translate it; but I thinke it
is to be rendred The Islands of the West, for (<em>jam</em>) in holy Scripture
signifies <em>The West</em>, as in <em>Gen.</em> 28.14. and in many other places; and
upon this account those <em>Israelites</em> are implyed, who are Westward
from the Holy Land, among whom the <em>Americans</em> are.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT.</em> 24.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The Prophet adds in <em>Isa.</em> 11.12. <em>And he shall set up a signe for
the Nations, and he shall assemble the out-casts of</em> Israel, <em>and
gather together the dispersed of</em> Judah <em>from the foure quarters of
the earth</em>. Where he notes two things; 1. That he cals the <em>Israelites</em>
out-casts, but the <em>Iewes</em> scattered; and the reason is, because
the ten Tribes are not only farre off from the Holy Land, but also they
live in the extremities and ends of Countries; from whence the Prophet
cals them <em>cast-out</em>. But he doth not say, that the <em>Israelites</em> are
to be gathered from the foure quarters of the Earth, because they are
not so dispersed through the World, as the Tribe of <em>Iudah</em> is, which
now hath Synagogues, not only in three parts of the World, but also in
<em>America</em>. The Prophet adds in <em>ver.</em> 13, <em>The envy also of</em> Ephraim
<em>shall depart, and the adversaries of</em> Judah <em>shall be cut off</em>. For then
there shall be no contention between <em>Iudah</em>, and the ten Tribes, which
are comprehended under the name of <em>Ephraim</em>, because their first King
<em>Jeroboam</em> was of that Tribe. And then, as it is in <em>Ezek.</em> 37.22.
<em>One King shall be King over them all, and they shall be no more two
Nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two Kingdoms.</em>
There shall be one King to them both, of the family of <em>David</em>. Also
the Lord at that redemption will dry up <em>Nilus</em>, and <em>Euphrates</em>, and
will divide it into seven streames (answerable to his drying up the
red Sea when they came out of <em>Ægypt</em>) perhaps that the seven
Tribes, which are in those parts, may goe over it; as they passe into
their Country, as <em>Isaiah</em> saith in ch. 27.12, 13. <em>And it shall be in that
day, and he shall shake off from the bank of the river</em>, (some understand
<em>Euphrates</em>) <em>unto the river of</em> Egypt (<em>Nilus</em>) <em>and ye, O children of</em>
Israel, <em>shall be gathered one by one</em>. Which was never done in the captivity
of <em>Babylon</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The Prophet <em>Isaiah</em> saith in chap. 11.11. <em>that he will return them
the second time</em>, &amp;c. Now the redemption from <em>Babilon</em>, cannot be
called such an one, because all of them were not brought back to their
Country. But the redemption shall be universall to all the Tribes, as it
was when they went out of <em>Ægypt</em>, which redemption shall be like the
first in many things, as I shewed in the third part of my <em>Reconciler</em>; and
so it may be called the second, in reference to that first from <em>Ægypt</em>.
Whence <em>Jeremiah</em> saith, Cha. 23.7, 8. <em>That then it shall not be said, He
that brought</em> Israel <em>out of</em> Egypt, <em>but from the North, and from all
Countries, whither he had driven them</em>. That they shall not mention
their departure from <em>Ægypt</em>, for the cause fore-mentioned.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT.</em> 25.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The same Prophet, <em>sc.</em> <em>Isa.</em> 43.5, 6. saith, <em>I will bring thy seed
from the East, and will gather thee from the West: I will say
to the North, Give up; and to the South, Keep not back; bring
my Sons from farre, and my Daughters from the ends of the earth</em>.
For <em>Media</em>, <em>Persia</em>, and <em>China</em>, lye on the East; <em>Tartary</em> and
<em>Scythia</em> on the North; the Kingdome of the <em>Abyssins</em> on the South;
<em>Europe</em> on the West, from the Holy Land. But when he saith, <em>Bring
ye my sons from farre</em>, he understands <em>America</em>; so that in those
verses he understands all those places, in which the Tribes are detained.
Also in Chap. 49. from ver. 7. to the end of the Chapter, he
saith, that that returne shall be most happy. And in ch. 56. vers. 8.
God saith, <em>He that gathers the out-casts of Israel</em>. And the Prophet
<em>Jeremiah</em>, in ch. 33. ver. 16. <em>In those dayes shall</em> Juda <em>be saved,
and</em> Jerusalem <em>shall dwell safely</em>. It is certaine, and <em>Jerome</em> assents
to all our Authors, that when <em>Judah</em> is joyned with <em>Israel</em>, by
<em>Israel</em> the ten Tribes are meant. The same adds in <em>chap.</em> 31. <em>ver.</em> 15.
in the comforting of <em>Rachel</em>, who wept for the carrying away her sons,
<em>Joseph</em>, and <em>Benjamin</em>, the first by <em>Salmaneser</em> into <em>Assyria</em>, the last
by <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em> into <em>Babilon</em>, he saith, in vers. 16. <em>Refraine thy
voyce from weeping, and thine eyes from teares, for thy work shall
be rewarded.</em> And it followes in Chap. 33. ver. 7. <em>And I will cause
the captivity of</em> Judah, <em>and the captivity of</em> Israel <em>to returne, and I
will build them up as at the first</em>. <em>Ezekiel</em> saith the same in Chap.
34.13. and in Chap. 37.16. under the figure of two sticks, on
which were written the names of <em>Judah</em>, and <em>Ephraim</em>, by which he
proves the gathering together of the twelve Tribes to be subject to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span><em>Messiah</em> the Son of David, in ver. 22. he saith, <em>And one King shall
be King to them all</em>; according as <em>Hosea</em> saith in Chap. 2. So
also saith <em>Amos</em>, in chap. 9. vers. 14, 15. <em>And I will bring againe
the captivity of my people</em> Israel, <em>and they shall build the wast Cities,
and inhabite them; and they shall plant vine-yards, and
drink the wine thereof: they shall make gardens, and eate the fruit of
them. And they shall be no more pulled up out of their Land, which
I have given them, saith the Lord thy God.</em> So also <em>Mica</em>. in cha.
2.12. <em>I will surely assemble</em>, O Jacob, <em>all of thee, I will gather the
remnant of</em> Israel, <em>I will also place him as the flock in the sheep-fold</em>.
For that in the captivity of <em>Babilon</em> all were not gathered together.
The Prophet <em>Zechariah</em> in chap. 8.7. and in chap. 10.6. and all the
rest of the Prophets do witnesse the same thing.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT.</em> 26.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>But which way that redemption shall be, no man can tell; but only
so farre as we may gather out of the Prophets. That at that time
the ten Tribes shall come to <em>Jerusalem</em> under the leading of a Prince,
whom some Rabbins in the <em>Talmud</em>, and in some places of the
Chaldy Paraphrase, doe call <em>Messiah</em> the Son of <em>Joseph</em>; and elsewhere
<em>Messiah</em> the Son of <em>Ephraim</em>; who being slaine in the last
War of <em>Gog</em> and <em>Magog</em>, shall shew himselfe to be <em>Messiah</em> the
sonne of <em>David</em>, who shall be, as <em>Ezekiel</em>,<a id='t43'></a> and <em>Hosea</em> say, <em>The everlasting
Prince of all the twelve Tribes</em>. Our wise men doe, in many
places, especially in the <em>Babilonian</em> Talmud, <em>in tract. suca</em>: <em>c.</em> 5. make
mention of that <em>Messiah</em> the sonne of <em>Ephraim</em>; where they say, that
he shall dye in the last war of <em>Gog</em>, and <em>Magog</em>; and they so expound
that of <em>Zach.</em> 12.10. <em>And they shall looke upon me whom
they have pierced, and they shall mourne for him, as one mourneth
for his only sonne.</em> They adde also, that the foure Captaines, of
whom the same Prophet speakes in chap. 11. are, <em>Messiah</em> the son of
<em>David</em>, <em>Messiah</em> the son of <em>Joseph</em>, the Prophet <em>Elias</em>, and the high
Priest; which foure are those dignities, which shall shew their power
in that blessed age. Observe, that sometime they call <em>Messiah</em> the
son of <em>Ephraim</em>, sometime of <em>Joseph</em>; for he shall come out of the
Tribe of <em>Ephraim</em>, and shall be Captaine of all the ten Tribes, who
gave their name to <em>Ephraim</em>, because that their first King <em>Jeroboam</em>
was of that Tribe. Not without cause doe they call him the son of
<em>Joseph</em>, for he was the true type of the house of <em>Israel</em>, in his imprisonment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>and future happinesse. Adde to this, that he was so long hid
from his brethren, that they did not know him: as in like manner the
ten Tribes are at this day, who are led captive, but hereafter shall
come to the top of felicity, in the same manner as <em>Joseph</em> did. That
<em>Messiah</em> of <em>Joseph</em> shall dye in the battel of <em>Gog</em>, and <em>Magog</em>, and
afterward shall rise againe, that he may enjoy the dignity, not of a
Kingly Scepter, but the office only of a Vice-roy, as <em>Joseph</em> in <em>Ægypt</em>;
for that the Empire of the house of <em>Israel</em> fell under the reigne
of <em>Hosea</em> the son of <em>Elah</em>; as the Prophet <em>Amos</em> saith in chap. 5.2.
Therefore the Kingdome of the ten Tribes shall not be restored, as
<em>Ezekiel</em> saith in Chap. 37. under the reigne of <em>Messiah</em> the son of
<em>David</em>, who shall be everlasting; and by the death of <em>Messiah</em> the
son of <em>Joseph</em>, the ten Tribes shall see, that God will not that they
should have more Kings then one. As its already spoken.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT.</em> 27.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Those Tribes then shall be gathered from all quarters of the earth,
into Countries neare to the Holy Land; namely, into <em>Assyria</em>, and
<em>Ægypt</em>; and from thence they shall goe into their Country; of
which <em>Isaiah</em> speakes, in chap. 27.13. <em>And it shall be in that day,
that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they who were lost, shall
come into the Land of</em> Assyria; <em>and they who were cast out, into</em>
Egypt; <em>and shall worship the Lord in the holy mount at</em> Jerusalem.
As if he should say, as trumpets sound, to call any army together:
so they shall come together, who were dead (that is, dispersed
through all <em>Asia</em>) into <em>Assyria</em>; and the out-casts (that is, which
are in <em>America</em>) shall come by the <em>Mediterranean</em> Sea to <em>Alexandria</em>
of <em>Ægypt</em>; and in the like manner those who are in <em>Africa</em>,
when <em>Nilus</em> shall be dried up, and <em>Euphrates</em> shall be divided; as
we have already said. And because the gathering together of the captivity,
shall begin at those who are in <em>America</em>, therefore <em>Isaiah</em>
saith, <em>The Islands shall trust in me, and the ships of</em> Tarsis (that is of
the Ocean) <em>first of all, that they may bring thy sons from farre, and
with them, their silver, and gold</em>. They shall then come with speed
from those Countries, prostrating themselves at the mountaine of the
Lord in <em>Jerusalem</em>, as the Prophet <em>Hosea</em> saith of that redemption
in chap. 11.11. <em>They shall come as birds out of</em> Egypt, and as
<em>Doves out of</em> Assyria; so saith <em>Isaiah</em> in Chap. 60.8. <em>Who are
those that fly as a cloud, and as Doves to their nests?</em> They which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>come first, shall also partake of this joy, to see others to come to them
every moment; for which cause the same Prophet saith, <em>Lift up thine
eyes round about, and behold them who gather themselves to thee</em>.
And because the two Countrys of <em>Assyria</em> and <em>Egypt</em>, shall first
of all kindly receive the people of <em>Israel</em>, and shall know the truth,
first of all imbracing the Religion of the Jewes, sacrificing and praying
to God, therefore the prophet <em>Isaiah</em> saith, in c. 19.25. <em>Blessed be
Egypt my people, and Assyria the worke of my hands; but Israel
is my inheritance.</em> For so those words are to be understood.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT.</em> 28.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>All those are the sayings of the holy Prophets, from whence
doth appeare the returne of Israel into their Country. It is
given to none to know the time thereof, neither is it revealed to <em>Rabby
Simeon ben Johay</em>, the Author of the Zoar; because that God
hath reserved that mystery to himself, as <em>Moses</em> saith. <em>It is hid with me.</em>
And <em>Isaiah</em> in ch. 63.4. <em>For the day of vengeance is in my heart,
and the year in which the redemption shall come.</em> Which the Rabbins
thus interpret, <em>I have reveiled it to my heart and not to Angells</em>:
and elsewhere, <em>If any man tell you when Messiah shall
come, beleeve him not</em>. So also the Angel saith to <em>Daniel</em> ch. 12.9.
<em>All things are closed up and sealed to the time of the end.</em> Therefore
all those, who search after that time, as <em>Rabbi Seadiah</em>, <em>Moses</em>
<em>Egyptius</em>, <em>Moses Gerundensis</em>, <em>Selomoh Jarchi</em>, <em>Abraham bar
Ribi Hijah</em>, <em>Abraham Zacculo</em>, <em>Mordehai Reato</em>, <em>and Isaac Abarbanel</em>,
have been mistaken; for that they would go beyond humane
capacity, and reveale that, which God concealed. And even
to <em>Daniel</em> himselfe (to whom was made knowne the secret of the
change of the four Monarchies) it was so revealed to him, that hee
confessed he did not understand it. Our Ancients did point at this
from the Letter (m) in <em>Isa.</em> 9.7. where he saith, <em>Of the increase of
his government</em>: which (m) in the Hebrew, being such an (m) which
they write onely in the end of words, and a close letter, yet is put in
the middle of the word, against common practise: because that the
time of the fifth Monarchy shall be hid, till the time when it shall
begin.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'><em>Yet this I can affirm, that it shall be about the end of this age</em>;
and so the Prophet speaks of that age <em>about the end of dayes</em>: and
that after many labours, and a long captivity. So <em>Balaam</em> prophesies,
<em>Numb.</em> 24.17. <em>I see, but not now; I behold, but not near; a Star
shall come out of Jacob.</em> Isa. 24.22. <em>They shall be cast into prison,
and they shall be visited after many daies.</em> And Isa. 49.14. <em>And
Sion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten
me.</em> Hos. 3.4, 5. <em>The children of Israel shall be many days
without a King, and without a Prince: And after that they shall
seek the Lord their God, and David their King.</em> The King and
Prophet complains of that delay, in <em>Psa.</em> 44. <em>Psa.</em> 69. <em>Psa.</em> 74. <em>Psa.</em> 77.
<em>Psal.</em> 83. And after that in <em>Psal.</em> 89.50.51. he thus concludes, <em>Remember,
O God, the reproach of thy servants, who suffer so many
injuries of so many people: wherewith they have reproached the
steps of thy Messiah</em>. As yet at this day it is said, that ALTHOUGH
THE MESSIAH WERE LAME, HE MIGHT HAVE COME
BY THIS TIME. Though we cannot exactly shew the time of
our redemption, yet we judge it to be near. For,</p>

<p class='c007'>1 We see many prophesies fulfilled, and others also which are subservient
to a preparation for the same redemption; and it appears by
this, that during that long and sore captivity, many calamities are
fore-told us under the four Monarchies. <em>David</em> saith in <em>Psal.</em> 120.7.
<em>Lord when I speake of peace, they speake of war.</em> And elsewhere,
<em>We are slaine all the day for thy name, and are accounted
for sheep which are slain</em>. In Isa. 53.7. <em>He shall be led as a sheep to
the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearers: he shall be dumb,
and shall not open his mouth.</em> O how have we seen these things in the
banishments of <em>England</em>, <em>France</em> and <em>Spaine</em>! and how have they
proved those crimes, which most false men have said that ours did
commit! Behold they have slaine them, not for wickednesses, which
they did not commit, but for their riches which they had. O how
have we seen all those things done by divine providence, for that those
misfortunes for the most part happened on the ninth day of the month
<em>Ab</em>, an ominous, and unhappy day, on which the first, and second
Temple were burnt, and the spies wept without a cause.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>What shall we say of that horrible monster, the Spanish Inquisition,
what cruelty hath not daily been used against a company
of miserable ones, innocents, old men, and children, of every
sex and age, who were slaine, because they could not divine who was
their secret accuser? But let us see, why in al those places (in which that
Spanish tyrannicall Empire rules,) they were slain, who would observe
the law of <em>Moses</em>; and by how many, and how great miracles hath
that law been confirmed; and what unrighteousnesse is there in it?
We daily see examples of constancy in ours, worthy of all praise, who
for the sanctifying of Gods name, have been burnt alive. Truly many
who are still living, can witnesse all those things. In the year 1603.
At <em>Lisbone</em>, <em>Diogo d’Assumean</em>, a Monk of 24. years, was burnt
alive, who defended himselfe in the Inquisition against some, who
would have reduced him to Christianity, who was born a Christian,
and made a Jew; which all wonder at; the Inquisitors being grieved
that they had published the reasons which he had alledged, would
have recalled their sentence; but it was then too late; for it was divulged
through the world, which I my selfe have by me. Also the
Lord <em>Lope de Veray Alacron</em> deserves the praise of Martyrdome, who
being born of a noble, and eminent Family, and very learned in the
Hebrew, and Latine tongues, did imbrace our Religion; neither
thought it sufficient to be such himselfe, but discovered himselfe to
many others; thereupon in <em>Ann.</em> 1644 in the twentieth of this age,
he being imprisoned at <em>Valladolid</em>, though he lived in the darke, yet
he discovered light to many; neither could the great number of Doctors,
nor the greater affliction of his parents, move him from his
enterprise, either by tears or by promises. He circumcised himself
in prison (O strange act, and worthy of all praise!) and named himselfe
<em>beleeving Judas</em>; and at last, as a second <em>Isaac</em>, offered himselfe
to the flames, contemning life, goods, and honours, that hee
might obtain immortall life, and good things that cannot perish; in
the 25<sup>th</sup> yeer of his age. Now though those were not of the family
of Israel, yet they obtained an immortall glory, which is better then
this life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Also we have many examples of our own, which did equalize them,
of which that is one, which is done in our time, and is worthy to be
remembred; <em>Isaac Castrensis Tartas</em> (whom I knew, and spoke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>with) a learned young man, and versed in the Greek, and Latine;
he being but newly come to <em>Fernambuc</em>, was taken by the <em>Portugese</em>,
and carryed to <em>Lisbone</em>, and burnt alive; he was a young man
of 24. years old; scorning riches, and honours, which were offered
to him, if he would turne Christian. They who say he was a traytor,
do lye egregiously; for he did defend that place where he was Governour,
most valiantly; as ours do deport themselves in those fortified
places which are committed to their charge. The same Martyrdom
was undergone at <em>Lima</em>, by <em>Eli Nazarenus</em>, in <em>Ann. 1639. Janu. 23.</em>
who after he had lived 14 whole years in prison, all which time hee
eat no flesh, lest he should defile his mouth; he called himselfe by
that name, after he had circumcised himselfe. Such a Martyr also,
this year, was <em>Thomas Terbinon</em> in the City of <em>Mexico</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 31.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>If the Lord fulfilled his word in calamities, he will fulfill it also in
felicities. Therefore <em>Rabbi Aquibah</em> laughed, when hee saw a
Fox run out of the Temple being destroyed, though his companions
wept; he saying, Now is fulfilled that prophecy of <em>Jeremiah</em>,
<em>Lament.</em> 5.18. <em>And the foxes shall run therein</em>; and he added, and
those blessings also shall follow, which the Lord hath promised. We
see all the curses of God come to passe, which are mentioned in <em>Leviticus</em>
and <em>Deuteronomy</em>; as well as those, which concerne our
being scattered to the ends of the earth (which is <em>Portugall</em>) and those
concerning the calamities of the Inquisition; and those of our banishments,
as I have opened in my booke, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De termino vitæ</span></cite>; from
whence it appears, that all the happy prophesies shall be fulfilled.
And as we have perished, so also shall <em>Bozra</em> (that is, <em>Rome</em>) perish.
See <em>Isa.</em> 34.6.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 32.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Secondly; The argument which we bring from our Constancy under
so many evills, cannot be eluded, that therefore God doth
reserve us for better things. <em>Moses</em> in <em>Levit.</em> 26.44. saith, <em>Though
they be in the land of their enemies, yet I will not cast them away,
neither will I abhor them to destroy them utterly, and to breake
my covenant with them, for I am the Lord their God</em>. And truly
these things are now fulfilled, for that in this captivity, and among
the many reproaches which we Jewes suffer, yet many of ours are

Ishac Abarbanel</em>, who comes of <em>Davids</em> line, is Counsellor to the
King of <em>Spaine</em>, and <em>Portugall</em>. By this also he hath got a great name,
for that he composed the differences, which arose beene the King of
<em>Portugall</em>, and the Republique of <em>Venice</em>. And from that Family of
<em>Äbarbanel</em> (which I note by the by) doe proceed my Children, by
my wives side. And in the house of his sonne, <em>D. Samuel Abarbanel</em>,
and of his wife <em>Benuenida</em>, the Lady <em>Leonora de Toledo</em>, was brought
up at <em>Naples</em>, who is the Daughter of <em>D. Peter de Toledo</em>, the
Vice-roy of <em>Naples</em>; who afterwards was married to the most eminent
Duke <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cosmus de Medicis</span></i>, and having obtained the Dukedome
of <em>Toscani</em>, she honoured <em>Benuenida</em> with as much honour, as if she
were her mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>That peace, which the <em>Venetians</em> made with the Emperour <em>Sultan
Selim</em>, 75. yeares agone, was made, and ratified by a certaine
Jew <em>Don Selomo Rophe</em>, who was sent Ambassadour to <em>Venice</em>, and
received with great pomp, by the <em>Venetians</em>. At <em>Constantinople</em> D.
<em>Ben Jaese</em>, <em>Anaucas</em>, and <em>Sonsinos</em> are of great authority with the
<em>Turk</em>. In <em>Ægypt</em> the <em>Jewes</em> were alwayes <em>Saraph baxas</em>, and also
at this day is <em>D. Abraham Alholn</em>. Who knowes not that <em>D. Josephus
Nassi</em>, otherwise called <em>Joannes Michesius</em>, about the 66. yeare
of the former age, was Duke of <em>Naccia</em>, Lord of <em>Milum</em>, and of the
seven Islands, of whom see <em>Famian</em>. <em>Strada</em> in <em>Histor. Belgic. part.</em>
1. <em>lib.</em> 5. He was raised to these honours by <em>Sultan Selim</em>. As also
by <em>Sultan Amurat</em>, <em>Jacob Aben Jaes</em>, otherwise called <em>Alvoro
Mendez</em>, was made Governour of <em>Tyberias</em>; witnesse <em>Boterus</em> in
<em>Relation, part.</em> 3. <em>lib.</em> 2. in <em>Barbary</em>, the Lords <em>Rutes</em> were always
Governours of <em>Sekes</em>, <em>Phes</em>, and <em>Taradanta</em>. In <em>Ann.</em> 1609. <em>D. Samuel
Palaxe</em> was sent Ambassadour to the States, by <em>Mulai Zidan</em>
the King of <em>Maracco</em>. But he dyed at the <em>Haghe</em> in <em>Anno.</em> 1616.
And the most eminent Prince <em>Maurice</em>, and the Nobles, were at his
Funerall. In <em>Persia</em> who knowes not of what account they are? There,
thirty years since, <em>Elhazar</em> was second to the King, and as it were Governour.
Now <em>David Jan</em> succeeds him, to whom others also being
joyned, they live in the Court. And that must not be forgot, that
when the most eminent Duke of <em>Holstein</em> sent <em>Otto Burchmannus</em>
Ambassadour to <em>Persia</em>, in <em>Ann.</em> 1635. he desired commendatory
letters from our <em>Jewes</em> at <em>Hamburgh</em>, to them, who (as we have
already told you) doe live there in the Court, that they would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>make way there, for him that was a stranger: that he might dispatch
his affaires: Which was also performed. By which means ours, who
are in <em>Persia</em>, dismissed <em>Burchmannus</em>, with rich gifts, and with
Letters to the most eminent Duke of <em>Holstein</em>, which the twelve
Chuzæ, or Princes, had subsigned. A copy of which Letters the most
excellent <em>D. Benjamin Mussapha</em>, one familiar with the Prince helped
me to. Also <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Claudius Duretu en son thresor des langues</span></i>, <em>fol.</em>
302. saith, that there are almost an infinite number of <em>Jewes</em> in <em>Asia</em>,
especially in <em>India</em>, and that King <em>Cochini</em> is their great favourer.
Yea <em>Linschotes</em> saith (where he treats of <em>Cochini</em>) that they have
Synagogues there, and that some of them are of the Kings Counsell.
At <em>Prague</em>, <em>Mordocheas Maisel</em> had Armes given him by the Emperour
<em>Matthias</em>, who also knighted him. Which honour <em>Iacob
Bathsebah</em> also had, under the Reigne of <em>Ferdinand</em>; and many other
Families are graced with other honours. And in this very captivity
(who could thinke it) they are so wealthy, that (Gods providence
favouring them) they may challenge to themselves a place among
the most Noble.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 33.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Who can enumerate the number of ours, who are renowned
by fame, and learning? The learned <em>R. Moses bar Maimon</em>
was Phisician to <em>Saladin</em> the King of <em>Ægypt</em>. <em>Moses Amon</em> to
the Emperour <em>Sultan Bajaseth</em>. <em>Elias Montalto</em> to the most eminent
Queen of France, <em>Loysia de Medicis</em>; and was also her Counsellor.
<em>At</em> Padua <em>Elias Cretensis</em> read Philosophy; and <em>R. Abraham
de Balmas</em>, the Hebrew Grammer. And how much honour had
<em>Elias Grammaticus</em> at <em>Rome</em>? And almost all the Princes of <em>Italy</em>
honoured him with all kinde of honour, <em>Abraham Kolorni</em>; as appeares
by a Letter writ to him by <em>Thomas Garzoni nella sua piazza
universale del mundo</em>. <em>Picus Mirandula</em> (who useth to say, <em>That
he had but small understanding, who only looked after his owne
things, and not after other mens</em>) and others, had Hebrew teachers.
<em>David de Pomis</em> dedicated his Book to Pope <em>Sextus</em> the fifth, who
lovingly, and courteously received both the Author, and work. So at
this day we see many desirous to learne the Hebrew tongue of our
men. Hence may be seene that God hath not left us; for if one persecute
us, another receives us civilly, and courteously; and if this Prince
treats us ill, another treats us well; if one banisheth us out of his country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>another invites us by a thousand priviledges; as divers Princes of
<em>Italy</em> have done, the most eminent King of <em>Denmarke</em>, and the mighty
Duke of <em>Savoy</em> in <em>Nissa</em>. <em>And doe we not see, that those Republiques
doe flourish, and much increase in Trade, which admit
the Israelites?</em></p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 34.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'><em>Moses</em> saith in his last song, that God would revenge the bloud
of his people who are scattered. And <em>Ieremiah</em> saith, in chap.
2.3. <em>Israel is the Lords holy thing, the first fruits of his increase;
all who devoure him shall be found guilty; evill shall come upon
them, saith the Lord.</em> And that the Histories of divers times, even
from <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em> to these very times, doe testifie. Have not
the Monarchies of great Princes been destroyed? Consider with me
the miserable ends of <em>Antiochus</em>, of <em>Pompey</em>, of <em>Sisibuthus</em>, of <em>Philip</em>
the King of <em>France</em>, of A<em>lonsus</em> the sonne of <em>Iohn</em> the second. And
we may remember, how King <em>Sebastian</em> with his fourth Generation,
and with all his Nobles, was slaine in a battell of A<em>frica</em>, in that same
place, in which he had caused the <em>Iews</em> to be banished. <em>Ferdinand</em>,
and <em>Isabel</em> were the great Persecutors of our Nation, but how did both
he, and she dye? as for him his Son-in-law, and his owne Subjects
did persecute him; and his only sonne dyed (leaving no issue) on his
Wedding-day, being seventeen yeares old. His daughter being Heire
of the Kingdome, and of her Fathers hatred, would not marry to <em>Emanuel</em>
King of <em>Portugal</em>, unlesse he would compell us to be banished,
and change our Religion. But she dyed in Child-birth of her Sonne
<em>Saragoci</em>, and also her Son, before he was halfe a yeare old; and the
succession was devolved upon the Kingdome of <em>Spaine</em>. It is not long
since, that the <em>Spaniards</em> exercised upon us at <em>Mantua</em>, what ever
cruelties they could invent; what shall we say of that at <em>Madrid</em>
in the yeare 1632, was done by the Inquisition, the King, and Princes
of the Kingdome concurring; but in the very same month dyed the
Infant <em>Charles</em>, and their Kingdome declined. What wonder is it if
God hath chastised divers Kingdomes by sundry wayes: but of this I
treat farther in my History of the <em>Iewes</em>. Let us conclude therefore,
that that good, which God hath promised, will shortly come, since we
see that we have suffered those evils, which he hath threatned us with,
by the Prophets.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c024'>The shortnesse of time (when we beleeve our redemption
shall appeare) is confirmed by this, that the Lord hath
promised that he will gather the two Tribes, <em>Iudah</em>, and
<em>Benjamin</em>, out of the foure quarters of the World, calling them
<em>Nephussim</em>. From whence you may gather, that for the fulfilling of
that, they must be scattered through all the corners of the World; as
<em>Daniel</em> saith, <em>Dan.</em> 12.7. <em>And when the scattering of the holy people
shall have an end, all those things shall be fulfilled.</em> And this appeares

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c024'>To these, let us adde that, which the same Prophet speakes,
in ch. 12. ver. 4. <em>That knowledge shall be encreased</em>; for
then the prophecies shall better be understood, the meaning
of which we can scarce attaine to, till they be fulfilled. So after the
<em>Otteman</em> race began to flourish, we understood the prophesie of the
two leggs of the Image of <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em>, which is to be overthrowne
by the fifth Monarchy, which shall be in the World. So <em>Jeremiah</em>
after he had handled in Chap. 30. the redemption of <em>Israel</em>,
and <em>Judah</em>, and of the war of <em>Gog</em>, and <em>Magog</em> (of which <em>Daniel</em>
also speakes in ch. 12.) when he treats of the Scepter of the Messiah
the son of <em>David</em>, of the ruine of the Nations, of the restoration of
<em>Judah</em>, of holy <em>Jerusalem</em>, and of the third Temple, he adds in ver.
24. <em>The fierce anger of the Lord shall not returne, till he hath executed
it, and till he hath performed the intents of his heart; in
the latter dayes ye shall understand it.</em> From whence followes what
we have said, that the time of redemption is at hand. And because
<em>Jeremiah</em> in that Chapter makes an abridgement of all things that
shall be, therefore it is said in ver. 2. <em>Write thee all the words which
I have spoken to thee in a book.</em> By this meane making the Prophecie
clearer, by relating in a cleare style, whatever the Prophets had
fore-told; imitating <em>Moses</em>, the last words of whose song are, <em>Sing, O
ye Nations, with his people</em>, in <em>Deut.</em> 32.43. Also the last words
which he spake, after that he had blessed the Tribes, are these, <em>Happy
art thou, O</em> Israel: <em>who is like to thee, O people? saved by the Lord,
who is the sheild of thy help, and the sword of thy excellency; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>thine enemies shall be found lyars to thee, and thou shalt tread upon
their high places</em>, in <em>Deut.</em> 33.29. From whence it appeares,
that God will revenge the bloud of <em>Israel</em>, which had been shed.
<em>Joel</em> confirmes the same in ch. 3.19. <em>Ægypt shall be a desolation</em>,
and <em>Edom shall be a filthy desert, for the violence, and injury offered
to the</em> Jewes, <em>and because they have shed innocent bloud in their
Land</em>. And as they shall be punished by the just judgement of God,
who wish us evill: so also God will give blessings upon them who favour
us. And those are the trees of the field which then shall rejoyce.
So God saith to <em>Abraham</em>, in <em>Gen.</em> 12.3. <em>I will blesse them
who blesse thee, and curse them that curse thee.</em></p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 37.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>These are the things which I could gather concerning this matter,
which hath not been heretofore handled; from whence these
consequences may be deduced.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. That the <em>West-Indies</em>, were anciently inhabited by a part of
the ten Tribes, which passed thither out of <em>Tartary</em>, by the Streight
of <em>Anian</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. That the Tribes are not in any one place, but in many; because
the Prophets have fore-told their return shall be into their Country,
out of divers places; <em>Isaiah</em> especially saith it shall be out of eight.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. That they did not returne to the second Temple.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. That at this day they keep the <em>Jewish</em> Religion.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. That the prophecies concerning their returne to their Country,
are of necessity to be fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. That from all coasts of the World they shall meet in those two
places, <em>sc.</em> <em>Assyria</em>, and <em>Ægypt</em>; God preparing an easie, pleasant
way, and abounding with all things, as <em>Isaiah</em> saith, ch. 49. and from
thence they shall flie to <em>Jerusalem</em>, as birds to their nests.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. That their Kingdome shall be no more divided; but the twelve
Tribes shall be joyned together under one Prince, that is under <em>Messiah</em>
the Son of <em>David</em>; and that they shall never be driven out of their
Land.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>I returne to the relation of our <em>Montezinus</em>, which I prefer before
the opinions of all others as most true for that <em>Peru</em> should be derived
from the name <em>Ophir</em>, as <em>Gulielmus Postellus</em>, <em>Goropius in Ortelius</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bozius de signis Eccles.</span></i> <em>lib.</em> 2. <em>c.</em> 3. <em>Marinus in arca Noah</em>, <em>P.

<em>c.</em> 8. do think, cannot be proved; as <em>Pineda</em> hath wel observed, in <em>Job</em>,
<em>c.</em> 28. <em>p.</em> 500. for we have said out of <em>Garcilasso de la Vega</em>, that that
name was unknown to them of <em>Peru</em>. <em>Ophir</em> then is <em>East-India</em>, if we
beleeve <em>Josephus</em>, <em>lib.</em> 8. <em>Antiquit. Judaic.</em> <em>c.</em> 6. &amp; <em>Acosta in lib. 1.
Histor. Ind.</em> from whence <em>Solomon</em> fetched gold, and precious stones.
But what <em>Gomara in part 1. hist. Ind.</em> <em>fol.</em> 120. and <em>Zarate in proæm.
hist. Peru</em>, would have, that ours did passe over that famous, and much
praised Island (by <em>Plato</em> in <em>Critia</em>, and <em>Timæus</em>) of <em>Atlantis</em>, and so
went into the neighbour Islands of <em>Barlovent</em>, and from thence to the
firm land, and at last to the Kingdom of <em>Peru</em>, and <em>New-Spain</em>; it is deservedly
exploded as fabulous; and <em>Acosta</em> laughs at it, <em>in lib. 1. hist.
Ind. c.</em> 22. But <em>Marcilius Ficinus in comment. in Timeum, c.</em> 4. &amp;
<em>Critia</em>, that he might defend <em>Plato</em>, thinkes (and his Disciples, <em>Porphiry</em>,
<em>Origen</em>, and <em>Proclus</em> doe follow him) that all that which is in
<em>Critia</em>, and in <em>Timæus</em>, is to be understood allegorically. And who
will beleeve <em>Lescarbotus</em>, who saith that they are the <em>Canaanites</em>,
who fled thither for feare of <em>Joshua</em>? For I cannot be perswaded that
they sought out Countries so far remote. They who will have them
of <em>Peru</em> to have come out of <em>Norwey</em>, or <em>Spain</em>, may be confuted by
their very form, manners and the unlikenesse of their Languages. But
that is more false, that they are <em>Israelites</em>, who have forgot circumcision,
and their rites. For they are of a comly body, and of a good wit, as
saith Doct. <em>Johannes Huarte</em>, in his book which is called, <cite>Examen ingenior.</cite>
<em>c.</em> 14. But contrarily all men know that the <em>Indians</em> are deformed,
dul, and altogether rude. And we have abundantly shown, with
how great study, and zeal, the <em>Israelites</em> have kept their Language, and
Religion, out of their Country.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 39.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'><em>Montezinus</em> then speaks most likely; that as other people forced
the <em>Israelites</em> to betake them to the mountains: so <em>America</em> being
first of all inhabited by the persecuting <em>Tartars</em>, they were driven
to the mountains of <em>Cordillere</em>, where at last they were hid, as God
would have it. Truly, comparing the <em>Israelites</em> themselves, or their
Laws, with other people, I see not anything that comes nearer truth.
Perhaps also <em>America</em> was not of old contiguous to <em>Asia</em> on the
North side. It doth not seeme to me such an absurdity, to say, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Israelites went out of <em>Tartary</em> into <em>America</em> by land; and afterward,
that God, to preserve his, among other miracles, also wrought this, to
make that a Sea, where now is the streight of <em>Anian</em>. Yea that might
be don without a miracle, by accident, as we know that more than once,
the Sea by a violent storm hath carryed away the Land, and made Islands.
<em>Xenophon in suis æquivoc.</em> mentions the inundations of <em>Ægypt</em>,
which happened in the days of <em>Prometheus</em>, and <em>Hercules</em>. Also <em>Berosus
in lib.</em> 5. and <em>Diodorus li.</em> 6. mentions the inundation of <em>Attica</em>,
in which <em>Athens</em> stands. <em>Pliny in lib.</em> 2. <em>c.</em> 85. &amp; <em>lib.</em> 13. <em>c.</em> 11. <em>Strabo
in l.</em> 1. &amp; <em>l.</em> 12. and <em>Plutarch in Alexandr.</em> relate the drowning of the
Isle <em>Pharaonica</em>; of which <em>Luther</em> speaks so elegantly in <em>lib. ultimo.</em>
Besides, who knows not how many, and how great Cities have at divers
times been almost wholly ruined by several earthquakes? <em>Sueton,
in Tiberio, c.</em> 48. writes, that under <em>Tiberius</em>, twelve Cities in <em>Asia</em>
have been by this means ruined. <em>Orosius lib.</em> 7. <em>c.</em> 4. and <em>Dion Cassius lib.</em>
57. do affirm the same, though they differ about the time. <em>Tacitus
in lib.</em> 14, and <em>Eusebius in Chron.</em> relate the destruction of that
famous and rich City of <em>Laodicea. Origen tom.</em> 28. <em>in Joan</em> and <em>Baronius
tom.</em> 2. <em>Annal. Ecclesiast, Ann.</em> 340: do speak of other earthquakes,
which have destroyed divers, and very many men, and Cities.
And <em>P. Alonsus in suo manual. tempor.</em> relates, that the same
hath happened in our dayes; saith he, In the year 1638. <em>A great
Earthquake happened in the Islands of the Terceræ, but especially
in St. Michael, where the Governour dwells; for that unheard
of shaking of the earth, and houses, struck so great terror into
the Inhabitants, that al fled out of their houses &amp; lived in the fields,
a little after, two miles from thence, they saw the Sea vomit up abundance
of fiery matter, which made a very thicke smoake,
which covered the very clouds; and it cast up many great stones
which seemed like rocks; part whereof falling downe againe, made
an Island in the Sea which was halfe a mile over, and sixty fathom
high, &amp; an hundred &amp; fifty fathom deep. That hot exhalation which
that fiery mountain sent forth, pierced the very waters, and stifled so
many fishes, that two Indian ships could not carry them.</em> The same
Island two years after, was swallowed up again of the Sea.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 40.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Hee that doth seriously weigh those things, may (I think) well
gather, that the Sea of the Streight of <em>Anian</em> was an inundation.
By affirming which, this doubt may be answered, <em>sc.</em> That after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the universall Flood, man-kinde encreased againe, and all beasts,
which had been preserved in the Arke. But how could so many kinds
of beasts, (which come by propagation, and are not bred out of the
earth) be found in those Countries? Some did swim thither, some
were brought thither by some huntsmen, some were bred out of
the earth, as <em>Austin</em> thinks it happened in the first Creation. But
what Land-beast can swim over so great a Sea? And would Huntsmen
carry Lyons thither, and other such kind of beasts, oftentimes to
the great hazzard of their lives? And if God would have created those
beasts out of the earth, he would not have commanded <em>Noah</em> to have
kept them in the Ark. I am fully perswaded, that the beasts which
are found there passed that way into <em>America</em>; unlesse any thinks that
this new world is joyned to the old, on some other side, as <em>Herrera</em> beleeves
<em>Dec.</em> 3. <em>lib.</em> 11. <em>c.</em> 10.</p>

<h3 class='c021'><em>SECT. 41.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>As for the other things in the relation of our <em>Montezinus</em>, they
say nothing which savours of falshood. For their saying that the
<em>Semah</em>, truly it is the custom of our people, in what part soever of the
world they live; and it is the abridgement of the confession and religion
of the Jewes. That revelation of the Magicians whom they call <em>Mohanes</em>,
it agrees with those things which in 2 <em>Esdras</em> you may see,
concerning the Miracles which God wrought for the Israelites, as they
passed over <em>Euphrates</em>, concerning those conditions of not revealing
secrets to any, but such an one who hath seen three hundred Moons,
(which make twenty five years) it appeares to be true, by what
the famous <em>De Laet</em> tells in many parts of <em>America</em>, that the <em>Indians</em>
do compute their years by Moones. That a secret must be told
in the Field, doth not that argue a <em>Jewish</em> custome, which the ancients
have observed in <em>Jacob</em>? who being about to depart from <em>Laban</em>, he
called his Wives into the field.</p>

<p class='c007'>I now conclude this discourse, in which this only was in my intention,
that I might briefly, and compendiously declare mine, and the
Rabbies opinion, concerning those things which I have handled. I
hope that this my indeavor will not be unacceptable, being desired by
many men famous both for Birth, and for Learning; not unprofitable,
having therein explained the relation of <em>Montezinus</em>, with what brevity
I could. The Name of God be blessed for ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>

God hath promised to doe great things in these last
days, as namely, to subdue all his Enemies, to releive
his people, to destroy all Tyranny and Oppression
both civil and ecclesiasticall, and to ampliate
the Bounds of Christs Kingdom, by a plentifull pouring
forth of his spirit, and by converting the multitudes both of Jews
and Gentiles. Herein he doth what the Ruler of the Feast said to the
Bridegroome in <em>John</em> 2.10. <em>he keepes the best wine till the last</em>;
he makes the last Act, the best part of the Comedy. Whereas the
method of the Devill, and the World, is contrary; represented by
<em>Nebuchadnezzars image</em>, whose head, or beginning, was of gold;
but the feet, or ending, was of iron, and clay. And of these great good
things (we being now upon the borders of the long-looked-for-<em>Canaan</em>)
God hath given us some earnest (which is a small proportion,
with the whole for kind) a bunch of grapes; <em>Og</em>, and the <em>Amorites</em>
subdued. For he hath in our days arrested the <em>Turks</em> greatnesse; abated
the formidablenesse of the <em>German-Austrian Beast</em>; revealed
in good measure the hypocrisie and lies of the false Prophet, who hath
his seat at <em>Rome</em>; and hath brought to light the subtilties of Satan,
who had shifted himselfe into severall dresses of pretended Reformation.
Hee is risen up like a mighty Gyant, against his enemies among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>us, and elsewhere, and hath pleaded his peoples cause so signally,
that all but those whose judgement it is to be wilfully blind, will
say, <em>The Lord is on our side</em>. He hath also scattered <em>Light</em>, and <em>Truth</em>
in an unwonted measure, among all sorts of people; he hath given
forth his owne good Spirit more plentifully than formerly (except in
those extraordinary primitive times of Christianism;) and hath instated
us into liberty for our spirits; which though too many abuse, and
turne into licentiousnesse, or a liberty to sinne, yet that is no dispraise,
but a commendation to the thing; for it is a signe that liberty is exceeding
good in itselfe, seeing the corruption or abuse of it, is a thing
so bad, but so hedged in by severall Fences, as it hath pleased God in
much mercy to direct the wisdome of our State to, it is a choyse
mercy, and such as is suitable to our Principles both Humane, and
Christian; Thus we have a Day-star to tell us that day is at hand;
something prodromous concerning almost all the great things promised,
and looked for, as might be more largely showne, if that were my
proper work. But yet nothing concerning <em>the returning of the Shulamite</em>,
in <em>Cant.</em> 6. <em>ult.</em> which Mr. <em>Brightman</em> interprets to be the
<em>Jewes</em> turning Christian, the clock of their conversion hath not yet given
warning; it is as midnight with them still, as it was a thousand
yeares agone. Upon which, some ground the hopelesnesse of their repentance,
but I dare not owne that Logick, but rather conclude thus;
That therefore their Conversion shall be the work of God (of which
more anon) with whom all difficulties are no hinderance; and though
<em>Israel</em> be bond-men in <em>Ægypt</em>, and sealed up to it by the darknesse
of a midnight, yet let but God speake, and they are immediately at
liberty, and sent away without waiting for the comming of the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now we ought much to minde their Conversion, exercising thereupon
our faith, our prayers, and also our enquiries, and that for these
following reasons:</p>

<p class='c007'><em>First</em>, because they have the same Humane nature with us; from
this ground we should wish well to all men, whether <em>Jew</em>, or <em>Gentile</em>;
which is the precept of the Apostle, in <em>2 Pet.</em> 1.7. <em>To adde
love to brotherly kindnesse</em>; that is, not only to love Saints, but to
love Men (though the Saints with a choyse, and peculiar love.) Yea
it is Gods owne practise, in <em>Mat.</em> 5.45. There is a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φιλανθρωπία</span> in
God (as <em>Paul</em> saith to <em>Titus</em>) a love to Man-kinde. <em>Plutarch</em>
could observe that God is not called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φίλιππος</span>, he beares another manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>of love to men, than to horses; so ought we to doe, and even upon
this generall account, to love the <em>Jewish</em> Nation.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Secondly</em>, because of their extraction; Their root is holy, though
now the Branches be degenerate and wilde; so in <em>Rom.</em> 11. vers. 16,
17. Some good turnes are due to the bad children of good Parents
for the Parents sake; and this <em>Paul</em> expresly urgeth, in <em>Rom.</em> 11.28.
<em>that they are beloved for the Fathers sake</em>; yea the chief root, or head
of their Nation, <em>Abraham</em> is mystically our substituted Father, as
in <em>Gal.</em> 4 last; <em>If ye be Christs, then are ye</em> Abrahams <em>seed, and
heires according to the promise</em>. The <em>Jewes</em> are children, and
heires of the flesh of <em>Abraham</em>, but we of his faith; they by the
Bond-woman, but we by the Free; but notwithstanding, <em>Abraham</em>
is our common Father, and therefore we should love as brethren.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Thirdly</em>, because Gods covenant with the <em>Jewes</em> is not nulled, or
broken, but only suspended. It is with them as it was with <em>Nebuchadnezzars</em>
tree, the leaves, fruit, and boughes were all scattered
and broken, yet there was a chaine of brasse upon the root, to reserve
that for future hopes; so though all true fruitfulnesse, beauty, and
symptoms of life are long since gone, yet there is a root, a seed, which
shall bring forth in Gods time; and this seemes a maine scope of <em>Paul</em>
in <em>Rom.</em> 11. To this purpose may that be alledged of <em>Mat.</em> 24.22.
<em>Except those dayes should be shortned, no flesh should be saved,
but for the Elects sake those dayes shall be shortned</em>; that is, so great
shall the slaughter of the <em>Jewes</em> be, at the destruction of <em>Jerusalem</em>,
that if those destroying dayes should last a little longer, their whole
Nation would faile, and be cut off; which shall not be, because God
hath elect ones to be borne of that People in future times. Hence you
see, that in their lowest ebbe, that is, in the midst of their greatest
guilt, and sorest punishments, God hath still an eye upon a number of
elect ones of that Nation; and Gods Covenant was never so with
them, or with any People, as to take the whole of them for his inheritance.
In <em>Jer.</em> 31.36, 37. Gods Covenant with <em>Israel</em> is surer
than the Lawes of Nature (which we know, remaine unviolable to the
Worlds end) and he saith, that must come to passe, before he will
cast off the Seed of <em>Israel</em>, for all that they have done; yea in <em>Isa.</em>
54.9, 10. God confirmes it to <em>Israel</em>, not only by the firmenesse of
the Lawes of Nature, but also by an Oath; now what God ratifies
with an Oath, is his absolute and positive Wil, that which makes the
conclusion immutable; as in <em>Heb.</em> 6.18. And in this case God is ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>too strong for all hardnesse of heart, disobedience, unbeleefe, and any
impediments that can be. See also that full place of <em>Levit.</em> 26.42.
44. and <em>ver.</em> 45. for I beleeve that place Propheticall, of times, and
things not yet fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Fourthly</em>, We <em>Gentiles</em> were gainers by their casting away, the
whirlwind of Gods wrath that threw them downe, brought us
much profit, even salvation itselfe, <em>Rom.</em> 11.12. <em>The fall of them becomes
the riches of the World</em>, ver. 15. <em>The casting away of them
is the reconciling of the World</em>; implying, that we <em>Gentiles</em> were
poore, and miserable, till made rich, and happy by the <em>Jewes</em> spoyles,
who by this meanes are as wretched as we formerly had been. Which
consideration must needs move an ingenuous spirit, to pitty those so
undone. Our Lord saith to a <em>Gentile</em>, in <em>Mark</em>, 7.27. <em>Let the
Children first be filled, for it is not meet to take the Childrens
bread and to cast it to the Doggs</em>: They were Children, and we were
Doggs, and we Doggs have got the Childrens meat before their bellies
were full; which, as it should make us not to be high-minded;
so also to pitty them, whose bread being taken away, and given to us,
are brought to a starving condition.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Fifthly</em>, We shall be gainers by their receiving againe; it should
be motive sufficient to us, that God shall be gainer by it, and that
not only by the accession of a whole Nation to him, and also of that
Nation, which is as the lost Sheep, the finding of which is a matter of
great joy, <em>Luke</em> 15. But also because as it is said in <em>Psal.</em> 102.16.
<em>When the Lord shall build up</em> Zion, <em>he shall appeare in his glory</em>.
Now glory is a manifestation of excellency, and at that time Gods
excellency shall shine forth, which is now much hid, and vailed; the
excellency of his mercy, of his truth and faithfulnesse, to remember
an ancient Covenant made about foure thousand yeares since, and his
old friend <em>Abraham</em>, and the Patriarks; all which have seemed to
be asleep for many Generations together. So also in <em>Isa.</em> chap. 12.
compared with chap. 11. But not only God (which might have
been a distinct reason) but we also shall receive great advantages
thereby; for then there shall be not only an enlargement of good to us
<em>Gentiles</em>, as a concomitant and synchronism with the <em>Jewes</em> conversion
(the mistake about which, hath, and doth cause black thoughts in
some) as in <em>Apoc.</em> 7.9. after the sealing of the hundred, and forty,
and foure thousand (which relates to the time of the forty two
moneths) a great multitude, and innumerable, of all Nations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Kindred, Tongues, and people stood before the Lambe, and were
cloathed with white Robes; now these numbers of all Gentile-Nations
are to be converted at that time when the <em>Jewes</em> are to be brought
home; for it is to be at the sounding of the seventh Trumpet. But
beside, the <em>Jewes</em> conversion shall in some sort be the cause of it,
else what meanes the Apostle in <em>Rom.</em> 11.12. <em>How much more shall
their fulnesse be the riches of the Gentiles?</em> and in vers. 15. <em>What
shall the receiving of the</em> Jewes <em>be</em> (to the <em>Gentiles</em>) <em>but life from
the dead</em>? The Apostle heightens the expression of the benefit by
their receiving, to an higher degree than what we got by their fall.
It is observable, that the Gospel did in some sense, first goe out of
<em>Sion</em>, for the Spirit who enabled the Disciples to preach and propagate
it was there given; and <em>Micah</em> speaking of the times yet looked
for, saith in <em>Mic.</em> 4.2. <em>The Law shall goe forth out of</em> Sion, <em>and the
Word of the Lord out of Jerusalem</em>; that is, the fulnesse of the
Spirit, and knowledge of Christ shall streame through the <em>Jewes</em> to
the <em>Gentiles</em>. So that as it was in the first giving of the holy Spirit, he
was first given to the <em>Jewes</em>, then to the <em>Gentiles</em>; yea by the <em>Jewes</em>
to the <em>Gentiles</em>; so shall it be in the last dayes, fulfilling what <em>Paul</em>
saith in <em>Rom.</em> 2. to the <em>Jew</em> first, and also to the <em>Gentile</em>, When God
shall be reconciled to <em>Israel</em>, their condition wil be greatly changed; for
they who are now actually the most accursed people, then as in <em>Mic.</em>
5.7. <em>The remnant of</em> Jacob <em>shall be in the midst of many people as
dew from the Lord; as the showres upon the grasse, that tarry not
for man, nor waite for the sons of men</em>. Dew, and Showers in those
hot Countries are Heavens bounty, a <em>cornucopia</em> of all good things;
such shall the <em>Jewes</em> be to the places where they shall be, when they
shall owne the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Sixthly</em>, They were Gods first Wife (as I may say); for a considerable
time they were a faithfull people; and many of them have
been Martyrs for God. And these things God will thinke on, though
we may sleight them.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were Gods first Wife. Did God ever assay to take any Nation
before them, to be his owne people? Yea, did he take any beside
them, for two thousand yeares together? In <em>Isa.</em> 54.6. <em>I have
called thee as a woman forsaken, and grieved in spirit, and a wife of
youth, when thou wast refused, saith the Lord</em>; and what follows,
vers. 7. <em>For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great
mercies will I gather thee.</em> And in verse 8. <em>With everlasting kindnesse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>will I have mercy upon thee.</em> We see God forgets not, though
men may, and doe.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were a faithfull people. As great was their unfaithfulnesse;
so there were times when great was their faithfulnesse. In <em>Jer.</em> 2.2.
<em>I remember thee, the kindnesse of thy youth, the love of thy espousals,
when thou wentest after me in the Wildernesse, in a Land that
was not sowne.</em> It was something to follow God in such a Country
forty years; and for so long a time to expose themselves, wives, and
children daily to almost al sorts of deaths; and you see, God remembers
it in after times; and if he did in <em>Jeremiahs</em> time, when those who in
person had been so faithfull, had been long dead; and that race of the
<em>Jewes</em> then were very provoking, and corrupt; why not also now, in
this present succeeding generation of them:</p>

<p class='c007'>They were Martyrs for God. To prove this, read the History of
the <em>Maccabees</em>, and if we like not so farre to owne what is Apocryphall,
turne to <em>Heb.</em> 11. which is a booke of the <em>Jewish</em> Martyrs, a
Catalogue of them that suffered under <em>Antiochus</em>, and those <em>Syrian</em>
Tyrants. And they were not few that suffered, but many; nor light
punishments, but unspeakeable torments. Now God takes it so kindly
that we give up our lives to torments, and to death for his Name,
that commonly he owes that person a good turne in his posterity. And
if upon these accounts God hath an eye upon them, we also should be
like minded, and love them too.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Seventhly</em>, It is a duty which we owe to Gods expresse command,
for so I take that in the literall sence, in <em>Isa.</em> 62.6, 7. <em>Ye that make
mention of the Lord, keep not silence, and give him no rest, till he
establish, and till he make</em> Jerusalem <em>a praise in the earth</em>. This
duty the Prophet himselfe performed in vers. 1. <em>For</em> Sions <em>sake I will
not hold my peace, and for</em> Jerusalems <em>sake I will not rest, till the
righteousnesse thereof goe forth as brightnesse, &amp;c.</em> And also the
Church in her affliction, <em>Psal.</em> 137.5, 6. And now that <em>Sion</em> is in the
dust, if we that beleeve among the <em>Gentiles</em>, did pitty her, and compassionate
her in her ruines, it were an argument that God is about to
arise, and have mercy upon her; as may be urged from Psalme 102.13,
14.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Lastly</em>, They minded our conversion to God. This appeares in
the writings of almost all their Prophets, especially in the Psalmes,
<em>Isaiah</em>, <em>Jeremiah</em>, <em>Hoseah</em>, <em>Malachi</em>. Now then for us to love
the notion, and in what we may, help forward their returne,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>what is it but an honest and just retaliation?</p>

<p class='c007'>Having dispatched the Reasons, two things yet remaine about their
Conversion, which I must speake somewhat to, and those are the
<em>Time</em>, and the <em>Manner</em>; as for the <em>time when</em>, the determining of
that is hard, though not impossible. I beleeve that it is punctually set
downe in Scripture, and God wil be as criticall in looking after times
as things; but all the difficulty of knowing it is from the darknesse,
and defects of our understanding, and not from a supposed uncertainty
in the thing. So that I am equally adverse as to the common practise
of the <em>Jewes</em>, who because they are unwilling to owne Gods accomplishments,
doe therefore dis-allow his computations, and expressly
hold that man accursed who busieth himselfe in that study. So to the
too common opinion of those who say, That oft in such computations
God puts a certaine number for an uncertaine. No, there is an infallibility
in the set times of Scripture; only the Well is deep, and
the cord to our Bucket is but short! yet this difficulty should not
cause despondency, but quicken our industry. All that I shall now
say to it is this, I judge the time not farre off; this present age will
see those things fulfilled which we have waited and prayed for. <em>R.
Maimonides</em> saith of Jesus Christ, That since <em>Moses</em> his time none
so like to the Messiah as the Christ of the Christians; so I say, since
Christ, no period of time so like to be that, in which the <em>Jewes</em> shall
be called, as this in which we live. And perhaps it is nearer than we
are aware of, being the more comfortably perswaded of it, by that
excellent Treatise called, <em>The Revelation revealed</em>, newly published
by a Gentleman of an indefatigable Spirit for God and publick good,
Mr. S. <em>Hartlib</em>, in which Apocalypticall computations are explained
the most harmoniously, and clearly, that I have read in any discourse
of that nature. He saith positively, that at the ending of the last yeare
of 1655. the seventh Trumpet shall sound; whose effect will be as
much good to Gods elected ones, whether <em>Jewes</em>, or <em>Gentiles</em>, as
our hearts can wish for. I shall adde this, The age in which we live,
hath been eyed by many Generations past, for the time wherein the
<em>Iewes</em> shall be received to mercy; many of their owne Writers, and
also of Christian Authors have pitched upon it; And I beleeve that
God will be as gracious to them in this their last, and greatest restauration,
as he was to them in that of their returne out of <em>Babylon</em>; now
concerning that there were three computations and epochaes of the
beginning (and consequently of the ending) of the seventy yeares of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>captivity; and observe, that those seventy yeares ended, and the
<em>Iewes</em> returned, not at the latest computation, but with the first, for
there were but seventy yeares from <em>Jechoniahs</em> carrying to <em>Babylon</em>,
(which was the first Captivity) to the release by the Proclamation of
<em>Cyrus</em>. And as God ended that Captivity with the soonest, so I
hope that he will doe this; especially considering, that speaking of
these mercies to them, in <em>Isa.</em> 60. in verse last, he saith, <em>I the Lord
will hasten it in its time</em>; which he should not doe, if he should
stay the longest calculation, and utmost period of time. O let us be
Gods Remembrancers to put him in minde of this his promise.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the <em>manner</em> how, and <em>meanes</em> whereby their conversion shall
be compassed; this also is a depth equall to the former. And as it is
in things Propheticall, the event will best determine it; yet I shall say
something to it, according to what I have attained. That of the ordinary
way of Christianizing a person, or people, seemes to me not of
use here; which hath been by Discourses, written or printed Books,
Preachers, or the will and command of a Conquerour; for all these
have had their efficacy in (at least a seeming and out-side) conversion
of many Nations. But after the application of these to the <em>Jewes</em>, for
many ages together, yet we must say as <em>Gehazi</em> did to <em>Elisha</em>, when he
had laid his staffe on the <em>Shunamite</em> her Son, thereby to bring him
to life; <em>The childe is not awaked</em>. I then conclude, that their conversion
shall be in an extraordinary way, it shall be the worke of our
Lord Jesus, and of his good Spirit. As <em>Paul</em> was turned by the appearing
of Christ to him; so shall they. He will manifest himselfe to
them eminently, powerfully, and graciously, to forme them to be a
people to himselfe. Whether this his presence to them shall be personall,
or only in the Spirit, I will not now say, but leave the Reader
to make a judgement, as he sees most cause, out of the Scriptures
which I bring. Consider that of <em>Mat.</em> 23.38, 39. <em>Behold your house
is left unto you desolate, for I say unto you, ye shall not see me
hence-forth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name
of the Lord.</em> Here you have their doome fore-told, <em>their house shall
be desolate</em>, the Temple and <em>Jerusalem shall be destroyed</em>; also
their conversion, in those words, their saying, <em>Blessed is he that
comes, &amp;c.</em> the <em>medium</em> to compasse it, cf. <em>their seeing Iesus
Christ; ye shall not see me</em>, &amp;c. In the order of causes, Christs discovering
himselfe to them shall be first, and shall produce their relenting
towards him. And for a further proofe, let those two places be joyned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>together, as bearing the same sence; that of <em>Mat.</em> 24.30, 31. and
of <em>Apoc.</em> 1.7. both which are taken out of <em>Zechar.</em> 12.10. And
all three not to be understood of Christs appearing to Judgement;
for here, saving repentance is the effect of his appearance; but repentance
will be then too late when the Judge is come; that shall be a
night to all sinners, in which no worke can be done. Againe, there are
but three grand periods mentioned in <em>Mat.</em> 24. namely, the destruction
of <em>Jerusalem</em>, Christs comming (when, and whereby the
<em>Jewes</em> shall be converted, who though they have resisted him, when
he came in the flesh, yet they shall not, they cannot, when he comes
in the Spirit) and the end of the World. Now the signes of the first
of these are in vers. 14, 15.21, 22. Of the second in vers. 29, 30, 31,
&amp;c. And of the last, in vers. 36, &amp;c. So that this of ver. 30, 31. must
concerne some other thing than the end of the World. And that the
three fore-named Scriptures are properly to be understood of the
<em>Jews</em>, the texts doe show; for that of <em>Zechariah</em>, (from whence the
other two places are taken) expresly saith, <em>I will poure upon the
house of</em> David, <em>and the inhabitants of</em> Jerusalem, <em>&amp;c.</em> and other
passages to the same purpose in vers. 11, 12, 13. of <em>Zechar.</em> 12. And in
the two places of <em>Mat.</em> 24. and <em>Apoc.</em> 1. it is expresly applyed to the
<em>Jewes</em>; for in <em>Mat.</em> it is, <em>All the Tribes of the earth shall mourn,
and see him</em>; that is, All the twelve Tribes scattered upon the face
of the whole earth, and these shall be gathered by the Angels from
the foure winds. And that of <em>Apoc.</em> 1.7. is clearly to be applyed also
to them, for it is said, <em>They that pierced him, shall see him</em>; that is,
the <em>Jewes</em>; and <em>All the Tribes</em> (for so the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυλαὶ</span> ought to be
rendred) <em>of the earth shall waile</em>; that is, the twelve Tribes scattered
throughout all places. Now the <em>meane</em> whereby these <em>Jewes</em> shall
be converted, is, <em>And they shall see him</em>; that is, Jesus Christ,
for those words are in all the three Scriptures. It shall be such a sight,
as the <em>Israelites</em> had of the Brazen Serpent in the Wildernesse, it was
healing to them. Such a sight as <em>Paul</em> had of Christ in Heaven, upon
which he saith, that he had seene the Lord. For particularities
about this sight. I shall leave them, knowing that <em>secret things doe
belong to God</em>.</p>

heare of it, you might see your owne sentence fulfilled then. First,

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c024'>I Received a Letter directed, <em>To the Translator of Spes Israelis</em>,
which worke thus corrected, as I here-with present to you, I confesse
mine. I left it with a friend to see it printed, my selfe going into
the Country; but his occasions called him from the City also, when
it should have been reviewed; which is the reason that though there
be many <em>Errata’s</em> in the Booke, that they are not gathered up at the
end. At my owne reading of it, I found many, and mended those I
found; and now I know that it hath farre fewer then it had, and may
passe tollerably; though neither I, nor what I doe, can be said faultlesse.
Concerning your desire of converting the <em>Jewes</em>, it is truly
Christian, and a worke that shall not loose its reward. But you say,
We disagree about the way, that is very possible, for apprehensions
are various, and men must thinke, not as others doe, but as themselves
can, taking what is truth to them, to be their guide. But the
<em>quære</em> is, Who lights on the best way. For my part, I pretend not
to any way to convert them, for I verily thinke that when it shall be
done, it will be Gods worke, and not mans; as much as Pauls conversion
was wholly of God; which himselfe makes the type, or patterne
of the conversion of his Country-men; as Mr. <em>Mede</em> saith upon
1 <em>Tim.</em> 1.16. in his <em>Fragmenta sacra</em>, which I know not whether
they be in print, or no. You say, I prize the learned <em>Iewes</em> writing
too much, and that it will beget pride in them (Sir, pardon me, if
I doe not recant till I see my errour; but then I shall freely doe it. I
confesse, I doe prize the Learned, whether <em>Iew</em>, or <em>Gentile</em>, for
though I am not <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σοφὸς</span>, yet I am <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φιλόσοφος</span> and I doe beleeve the
Author of <em>Spes Israelis</em> to be a very learned man; and I have it from
those who are acquainted with him, that he is a very ingenuous and
civill man; and others there are, and have been among them, not
wanting a name for good learning. As for the fomenting their pride)
truly that vice is of evill, that I would not cherish it, neither in myself,
nor in others. But Sir, whether is a more likely way to gaine upon
men, to use them civilly, and with the spirit of meeknesse, or to be
supercilious and tart towards them? What got <em>Austine</em> the Monke
by using the Brittaines of <em>Bangor</em> so Lordly as he did? and (to come
to latter dayes) did Mr. <em>Broughton</em> gaine upon a learned Rabbi, in a
Conference at <em>Dort</em>, where Mr. <em>Forbes</em> was Moderator, by his high
and peremptory language? This he reaped, to set the <em>Iew</em> at a greater
distance from Christianisme, and an abating of his owne esteeme, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the judgement of wise men. As for <em>Menasseh’s</em> Sabbaticall river, I
know many Authors have said it, but whether true, or false, that is
nothing to the Translator; and I am as farre from beleeving that story,
as I am from the wilde opinions of Mr. <em>Thrask</em>. But these are of lesse
concernment; you fall upon the maine of your judgement which relates
to them, and pardon me if I deale as roundly in my answer; for
I desire to have respect to Truth, and not to man. I doe firmly beleeve,
and feare not to professe it; That the <em>Jewes</em> shall be called as a
Nation, both <em>Judah</em> and <em>Israel</em>, and shall returne to their owne Land,
and have an earthly Kingdome againe. For the proofe of which, I
could say much, but shall now but little; and if possibly I cite any
thing which <em>Menasseh Ben Israel</em> brings for himselfe, beleeve me that
I have it not from him, but from my owne observations out of Scripture,
some yeares since. There is weight in that place of <em>Mic.</em> 4.8.
<em>The first dominion, the Kingdome shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem</em>;
and this is spoken of times after Christs incarnation, and
not yet performed. See that of <em>Zech.</em> 10.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. there is
<em>Judah</em> and <em>Ephraim</em> fore-told to be brought to <em>Gilead</em>, and <em>Lebanon</em>,
and they shall so encrease, that they shall want room. Say not this
was done in the returne of those now from the Captivity of <em>Babylon</em>;
for those of the ten Tribes that then returned, were but some gleanings
of them; and of <em>Judah</em> it selfe, there returned but about one halfe:
now God doth not promise Mountaines, and performe but Mole-hils;
yea in vers. 6. <em>God will save and strengthen the house of</em> Judah, <em>and
of</em> Joseph, <em>and they shall be as though I had not cast them off</em>.
Which, if since that Prophesie, it hath been made good of <em>Judah</em>, yet be
sure not of <em>Joseph</em>. And in v. 7. <em>They of</em> Ephraim <em>shall be like a mighty
man</em>, but since the captivity of <em>Salmanassar</em> to this day, what
might hath <em>Ephraim</em> shown? yea is he not poore, weak, scattered,
and unknowne? And in ver. 8. <em>I will gather them, and they shall
encrease as they have encreased</em>; hath this been fulfilled of <em>Ephraim</em>?
Where is his fruitfulnesse, which his name imports? much lesse
hath there been a time since their great captivity, in which they have
encreased to their numbers and strength, mentioned in the dayes of
<em>Moses</em>, <em>Joshua</em>, <em>David</em>, <em>Solomon</em>, and under their owne Kings, after
the defection from the house of <em>David</em>. See that noted place of
<em>Ezek.</em> 37.16, 17. 22.24, 25. Sir, in good earnest, hath this Scripture
been fulfilled? hath <em>Judah</em> and <em>Ephraim</em> been <em>but one stick
in Gods hand, but one Nation, so that they shall be no more two Nations</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>as in ver. 22. Surely to this day they have been from their last
dispersion not only two, but many Nations. Neither will it be an answer
to say, That now they are no Nation, therefore they are not two;
yes, Historians report them many Nations; though perhaps scarce after
the just rules of Nations. And that phrase hath not a negative, but
a positive sence, not that they should be nothing, but that they should
be one Nation. More-over, in ver. 24. <em>Judah</em> and <em>Ephraim</em> were so to
be one Nation, that <em>David</em> (that is Jesus Christ) was to be King over
them: And when did <em>Judah</em> and <em>Israel</em> ever to this day, as a Nation
acknowledge the Soveraignty of Jesus Christ? and he to be their
Prince for ever, as in ver. 25. But I must not too much enlarge. I
shall only adde this; That as many places of the Old, so many in the
New Testament agree thereto, as <em>Rom.</em> 11. ver. 12. 15. 25, 26. 28.
Though this of the <em>Romans</em>, chiefly proves one point, <em>sc.</em> their generall
or Nationall conversion. Give me leave briefly to answer your
objections. You say, The call of <em>Judah</em> and <em>Benjamin</em> is not so likely,
because Christ and the Apostles preached to them already. I answer;
that by their preaching, all of those living, who were elected, were converted;
but after-ages have a new race, and God hath his number among
them too; yea the words run high, then <em>All Israel shall be saved</em>.
You say, those two Tribes who crucified Christ, not so likely to
be converted. I answer, by how much their sin is greater, by so much
the greater will Gods mercy be; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et Dei novissima erunt optima, &amp;
maxima</span></i>. You say, Their conversion shall be single, that is answered
already; but I adde, that <em>Isaiah</em> is contrary to it, in <em>Isa.</em> 66.7, 8.
which Chapter I doubt not but it points to times after our Saviour. As
for their being engraffed upon the Vine Christ, or being brought to
one sheep-fold, what doth that hinder but that they may be a Nation
of Converts brought to their owne Land? You object that of <em>Rom.</em>
11.31. <em>That through your mercy they may obtaine mercy.</em> I answer,
that I beleeve the maine of their conversion will be from Heaven,
and extraordinary; though the <em>Gentiles</em> by provoking them to emulation,
and also by their gifts and graces, may some way be auxiliary
to them. After this you are pleased to put the term <em>Millenarian</em> upon
me; which, though for what I have writ, I need not owne, yet I
will not disclaime; they are not Names that affright me, but reall falsities.
The term <em>Chiliast</em>, as it congregates the many odde, and false
opinions of them of old, I explode; though to beleeve those thousand
yeares in <em>Apoc.</em> 20. to be yet unfulfilled, that, I willingly owne. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>put that sense upon them, as that they imply the thousand yeares of
eternity, I can thinke little lesse of it then to be a contradiction. Againe,
if the thousand yeares be the eternity in Heaven, what meanes that in
ver. 3. <em>Till the thousand yeares be fulfilled, and after that he must
be loosed for a little season</em>; I pray, what little season is that that is
after eternity? neither doth Christs <em>comming suddenly in the night
as a theife</em>, hinder, but that when he doth come, he may stay a thousand
yeares. But whether that time be <em>ante</em>, <em>in</em>, or <em>post diem judicii</em>, is
not my taske to determine, or maintaine. As for what you adde in the
Post-script, not to looke for a fifth Monarchy, because Christ reignes
now. I answer, that though he reignes <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</span></i>, yet not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i>; for
expresly in Scripture the Devill is called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοσμοκράτωρ</span> he is the grand
Tyrant, and great Usurper, and the whole world <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεῖται ἐν πὁ πονηρῶ</span>
yet I am farre from denying to Christ a Kingdome now in being, <em>sc.</em>
Spirituall, and Invisible, but I looke for a visible one to come. In the
close (as also at the beginning) you are pleased to desire my acquaintance;
but Sir, I look not upon my self as a Star of so considerable a
magnitude, as to present my selfe to your eyes; but if I might be so
happy as to be capable to serve you really, none should be more desirous
of it (both as you are a Gentleman of Learning, by which you
have obliged the publick; and also a Member of that House which I so
much honour) than Sir,</p>

Give me leave, at such a juncture of time, to
speak to your Highnesse, in a style and
manner fitting to us <em>Jewes</em> and our condition.
It is a thing most certaine, that the
great God of <em>Israel</em>, Creator of Heaven
and Earth, doth give and take away Dominions
and Empires, according to his owne pleasure; exalting
some, and overthrowing others: who, seeing he
hath the hearts of Kings in his hand, he easily moves them
whithersoever himselfe pleaseth, to put in execution his
Divine Commands. This, my Lord, appeares most evidently
out of those words of <em>Daniel</em>, where he, rendring
thanks unto God, for revealing unto him that prodigious
Dreame of <em>Nebuchadnezar</em>, doth say: <em>Thou that removest
Kings, and sets up Kings</em>. And else-where, <em>To the
end the living might know, that the Highest hath dominion
in Mans Kingdome, and giveth the same to whom he
please</em>. Of the very same-minde are the <em>Thalmudists</em> likewise,
affirming that a good Government, or Governor,
is a Heavenly Gift, and that there is no Governor, but
is first called by God unto that dignity: and this they
prove from that passage of <em>Exodus</em>: <em>Behold I have called
Bazale’l by name</em>, &amp;c. all things being governed by
Divine Providence, God dispensing rewards unto Vertues,
and punishment unto Vices, according to his owne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>good Will. This the Examples of great Monarchs make
good; especially of such, who have afflicted the people
of <em>Israel</em>: For none hath ever afflicted them, who hath
not been by some ominous <em>Exit</em>, most heavily punished
of God Almighty; as is manifest from the Histories
of those Kings, <em>Pharaoh</em>, <em>Nebuchadnezar</em>, <em>Antiochus</em>,
<em>Epiphanius</em>, <em>Pompey</em>, and others. And on the contrary, none
ever was a Benefactor to that people, and cherished them
in their Countries, who thereupon hath not presently begun
very much to flourish. In so much that the Oracle
to <em>Abraham</em> (<em>I will blesse them that blesse thee, and curse
them that curse thee</em>) seemeth yet daily to have its accomplishment.
Hence I, one of the least among the <em>Hebrews</em>,
since by experience I have found, that through Gods great
bounty toward us, many considerable and eminent persons
both for Piety and Power, are moved with sincere
and inward pitty and compassion towards us, and do comfort
us concerning the approaching deliverance of <em>Israel</em>,
could not but for my self, and in the behalf of my Countrey
men, make this my humble addresse to your Highness,
and beseech you for Gods sake, that ye would, according
to that Piety and Power wherein you are eminent beyond
others, vouchsafe to grant, that the Great and Glorious
Name of the Lord our God may be extolled, and solemnly
worshiped and praised by us through all the bounds of
this Common-wealth; and to grant us place in your Countrey,
that we may have our Synagogues, and free exercise
of our Religion. I nothing doubting, but that your Clemency
will easily grant this most equitable Petition of ours. Pagans
have of old, out of reverence to the God of <em>Israel</em>;
&amp; the esteem they had to his people, granted most willingly
free liberty, even to apostated <em>Jewes</em>; as <em>Onias</em> the High
Priest, to build another Temple in their Countrey, like
unto that at <em>Jerusalem</em>: how much more then may we,
that are not Apostate or runagate <em>Iewes</em>, hope it from your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Highnesse and your Christian Councill, since you have so
great knowledge of, and adore the same one onely God of
<em>Israel</em>, together with us. Besides, it increases our confidence
of your bounty towards us, in that so soon as ever the rumour
of that most wished-for liberty, that ye were a thinking
to grant us, was made known unto our Countrey-men;
I, in the name of my Nation, the <em>Iewes</em>, that live in <em>Holland</em>,
did congratulate and entertaine their Excellencies,
the Ambassadors of <em>England</em>; who were received in our
Synagogue with as great pomp and applause, Hymns and
cheerfulnesse of minde, as ever any Soveraigne Prince was.
For our people did in their owne mindes presage, that the
Kingly Government being now changed into that of a
Common-wealth, the antient hatred towards them, would
also be changed into good-will: that those rigorous Laws
(if any there be yet extant, made under the Kings) against
so innocent a people, would happily be repealed. So that
we hope now for better from your gentleness, &amp; goodness,
since, from the beginning of your Government of this
Common-wealth, your Highnesse hath professed much respect,
and favour towards us. Wherefore I humbly entreat
your Highnesse, that you would with a gracious eye have
regard unto us, and our Petition, and grant unto us, as you
have done unto others, free exercise of our Religion, that
we may have our Synagogues, and keep our own publick
worship, as our brethren doe in <em>Italy</em>, <em>Germany</em>, <em>Poland</em>,
and many other places, and we shall pray for the happinesse
and Peace of this your much renowned and puissant
Common-wealth.</p>

<em>Having some yeares since often perceived that
in this Nation, God hath a People, that is
very tender-hearted, and well-wishing to our
sore-afflicted Nation; Yea, I my selfe having
some Experience thereof, in divers
Eminent persons, excelling both in Piety and
Learning: I thought with my-self, I should do no small service
to my owne Nation, as also to the People and Inhabitants of
this Common-wealth, if by humble addresses to the late Honourable
Parliament, I might obtaine a safe-Conduct once to
transport my selfe thither. Which I having done, and according
to my desire, received a most kinde and satisfactory Answer,
I now am come. And to the end all Men may know the
true Motives and Intent of this my coming, I shall briefly
comprehend and deliver them in these particulars.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>First and formost, <em>my Intention is to try, is by Gods
good hand over me, I may obtaine here for my Nation the Liberty
of a free and publick Synagogue, wherein we may daily
call upon the Lord our God, that once he may be pleased to remember
his Mercies and Promises done to our Fore fathers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>forgiving our trespasses, and restoring us once againe into
our fathers Inheritance; and besides to sue also for a blessing
upon this Nation, and People of</em> England, <em>for receiving us
into their bosomes, and comforting</em> Sion <em>in her distresse</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>My</em> second <em>Motive is, because the opinion of many
Christians and mine doe concurre herein, that we both believe
that the restoring time of our Nation into their Native
Countrey, is very neer at hand; I believing more particularly,
that this restauration cannot be, before these words
of</em> Daniel, Chap. 12. ver. 7. <em>be first accomplished, when he
saith</em>, And when the dispersion of the Holy people shall
be compleated in all places, then shall all these things be
compleated: <em>signifying therewith, that before all be fulfilled,
the People of God must be first dispersed into all places &amp; Countreyes
of the World. Now we know, how our Nation at the
present is spread all about, and hath its seat and dwelling in
the most flourishing parts of all the Kingdomes, and Countreys
of the World, as well in</em> America, <em>as in the other three parts
thereof; except onely in this considerable and mighty Island.
And therefore this remains onely in my judgement, before
the</em> <span class='sc'>Messia</span> <em>come and restore our Nation, that first we must
have our seat here likewise</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>My</em> third <em>Motive is grounded on the profit that I conceive
this Common wealth is to reap, if it shall vouchsafe to receive
us; for thence, I hope, there will follow a great blessing from
God upon them, and a very abundant trading into, and from
all parts of the World, not onely without prejudice to the English
Nation, but for their profit, both in Importation, and
Exportation of goods. Yet if any shall doubt hereof, I trust
their Charity towards the people of God, will satisfie them,
especially when they shall reade the ensuing Treatise</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>The</em> fourth <em>Motive of my coming hither, is, my sincere affection
to this Common wealth, by reason of so many Worthy,
Learned, and Pious men in this Nation, whose loving kindnesse
and Piety I have experience of: hoping to finde the like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>affection in all the People generally; the more, because I alwayes
have, both by writing and deeds, professed much inclination
to this Common-wealth; and that I perswade my selfe
they will be mindfull of that Command of the Lord our God,
who so highly recommends unto all men the</em> love of strangers;
<em>much more to those that professe their good affection to them.
For this I desire all may be confident of, that I am not come to
make any disturbance, or to move any disputes about matters
of Religion; but onely to live with my Nation in the feare
of the Lord, under the shadow of your protection, whiles we
expect with you</em> the hope of Israel <em>to be revealed</em>.</p>

<em>Three</em> things, if it please your Highnesse, there
are that make a strange <em>Nation</em> wel-beloved amongst
the Natives of a land where they dwell:
(as the defect of those <em>three</em> things make them
hatefull.) viz. <em>Profit</em>, they may receive from
them; <em>Fidelity</em> they hold towards their Princes;
and the <em>Noblenes</em> and purity of their blood.
Now when I shall have made good, that all <em>these three</em> things are
found in the <em>Iewish Nation</em>, I shall certainly persuade your Highnesse,
that with a favorable eye, (Monarchy being changed into a
Republicq) you shall be pleased to receive again the Nation of the
Iews, who in time past lived in that Island: but, I know not by
what false Informations, were cruelly handled and banished.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Profit</em> is a most powerfull motive, and which all the World preferres
before all other things: and therefore we shall handle that
point first.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a thing confirmed, that merchandizing is, as it were, the proper
profession of the Nation of the Iews. I attribute this in the first
place, to the particular Providence and mercy of God towards his
people: for having banished them from their own Country, yet not
from his Protection, he hath given them, as it were, a naturall instinct,
by which they might not onely gain what was necessary for
their need, but that they should also thrive in Riches and possessions;
whereby they should not onely become gracious to their
Princes and Lords, but that they should be invited by others to
come and dwell in their Lands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, it cannot be denyed, but that necessity stirrs up a mans
ability and industry; and that it gives him great incitement, by all
means to trie the favour of Providence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Besides, seeing it is no wisedome for them to endeavour the
gaining of Lands and other immovable goods, and so to imprison
their possessions here, where their persons are subject to so many
casualities, banishments and peregrinations; they are forced to
use marchandizing untill that time, when they shall returne to their
own Country, that then as God hath promised by the Prophet Zachary,
<em>Their shall be found no more any marchant amongst them in
the House of the Lord</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>From that very thing we have said, there riseth an infallible Profit,
commodity and gain to all those Princes in whose Lands they
dwell above all other strange Nations whatsoever, as experience
by divers <em>Reasons</em> doth confirme.</p>

<p class='c007'>I. The Iews, have no oportunity to live in their own Country,
to till the Lands or other like employments, give themselves wholy
unto merchandizing, and for contriving new Inventions, no Nation
almost going beyond them. And so ’tis observed, that wheresoever
they go to dwell, there presently the Traficq begins to florish.
Which may be seen in divers places, especially in Ligorne,
which having been but a very ignoble and inconsiderable City, is
at this time, by the great concourse of people, one of the most famous
places of Trafique of whole Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Furthermore, the Inventor of the famous <em>Scala de Spalatro</em> (the
most firme and solid Traficq of Venice) was a Iew, who by this his
Invention transported the Negotiation from a great part of the Levant
into that City.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even that very same is seene likewise at this day in Nizza and in
other innumerable places more, both in Europe and Asia.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. The Nation of the Iews is dispersed throughout the whole
World, it being a chastisement that God hath layd upon them for
their Idolatries, Deut. 28,69. Ezech. 20,23. Nehem. 1,8. Ps. 107,27.
and by other their sinnes their families suffer the same shipwrack.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now in this dispersion our Fore-fathers flying from the Spanish
Inquisition, some of them came in Holland, others got into Italy,
and others betooke themselves into Asia; and so easily they credit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>one another; and by that meanes they draw the Negotiation
where-ever they are, where with all of them marchandising and
having perfect knowledge of all the kinds of Moneys, Diamants,
Cochinil, Indigo, Wines, Oyle, and other Commodities, that
serve from place to place; especially holding correspondence with
their friends and kinds-folk, whose language they understand; they
do abundantly enrich the Lands and Countrys of strangers, where
they live, not onely with what is requisite and necessary for the life
of man; but also what may serve for ornament to his civill condition.
Of which <em>Traficq</em>, there ariseth ordinarily <em>Five</em> important benefits.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The augmentation of the Publiq Tolls and Customes, at their
coming and going out of the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The transporting and bringing in of marchandises from remote
Countries.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The affording of Materials in great plenty for all Mechaniqs;
as Wooll, Leather, Wines; Jewels, as Diamants, Pearles, and such
like Merchandize.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The venting and exportation of so many kinds of Manifactures.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. The Commerce and reciprocall Negotiation at Sea, which
is the ground of Peace between neighbour Nations, and of great
profit to their own Fellow-cittizens.</p>

<p class='c007'>III. This reason is the more strengthened, when we see, that
not onely the Iewish Nation dwelling in Holland and Italy, trafficqs
with their own stock, but also with the riches of many others of
their own Nation, friends, kinds-men and acquaintance, which notwithstanding
live in Spaine, and send unto them their moneys and
goods, which they hold in their hands, and content themselves with
a very small portion of their estate, to the end they may be secure
and free from danger that might happen unto them, in case they
should fall under the yoke of the Inquisition; whence not onely
their goods, but oftentimes also their lives are endangered.</p>

<p class='c007'>IV. The love that men ordinarily beare to their own Country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>and the desire they have to end their lives, where they had their begining,
is the cause, that most strangers having gotten riches where
they are in a forain land, are commonly taken in a desire to returne
to their native soil, and there peaceably to enjoy their estate; so that
as they were a help to the places where they lived, and negotiated
while they remained there; so when they depart from thence, they
carry all away, and spoile them of their wealth: transporting all into
their own native Country: But with the Iews the case is farre different;
for where the Iews are once kindly receaved, they make a
firm resolution never to depart from thence, seeing they have no
proper place of their own: and so they are alwayes with their goods
in the Cities where they live, a perpetuall benefit to all payments.
Which reasons do clearly proove, that it being the property of Cittizens
in populous and rich countries, to seeke their rest and ease
with buying lands and faire possession of which they live; many of
them hating commerce, aspire to Titles and Dignities: therefore
of all strangers, in whose hands ordinarily Trafique is found, there
are none so profitable and beneficiall to the place where they trade
and live, as is the Nation of the Iews. And seeing amongst the people
of Europ, the chiefest riches they possesse, som from Spain, those
neighbour Nations, where the Iews shall finde liberty to live according
to their own Iudaicall Laws, they shall most easily draw that
benefit to themselves by means of the industry of our Nation, and
their mutuall correspondance.</p>

<p class='c007'>From hence (if it please your Highnes) it results, that the Iewish
Nation, though scattered through the whole World, are not therefore
a despisable people, but as a Plant worthy to be planted in the
whole world, and received into Populous Cities: who ought to
plant them in those places, which are most secure from danger;
being trees of most savory fruit and profit, to be alwayes most favoured
with Laws and Priviledges, or Prerogatives, secured and
defended by Armes. An Example of this we have in our times. His
Majesty, the Illustrious King of Denmark, invited them with speciall
Priviledges into Geluckstadt: the Duke of Savoy into Nisa of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Provence; and the Duke of Modina in Retio, allowing them such
conditions and benefices, as like never were presented unto them
by any other Prince, as appeareth by the copy of those Priviledges,
which I have in my hands. But supposing it would be a matter of
too large extention, if I should make a relation of all the places under
whose Princes the Iews live, I will onely speake briefly of the
two Tribes Iudah and Benjamin. These in India in Cochin have
4 Synagogues, one part of these Iews being there of a white colour,
and three of a tawny; these being most favoured by the King.
In the year 1640. dyed Samuel Castoel, Governour of the City,
and Agent for the King, and David Castoel his sonne succeeded
in his place. In Persia there is a great number of Iews, and they live
indifferent freely: there are also amongst them that are in favour
and great respect by the King, and who live there very bravely.
Some years past, there was Elhazar Huza, the Viceroy, and now
there is David Ian; if yet he be living. In the year 1636. the Saltan
Amarat took in Bagdad, and puting all to the sword, he commanded
that they should not touch the Iews, nor their houses, and besides
that, he freed them from one half of the tribuit they were wont to
pay to the Persian.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the chiefest place where the Iews life, is the Turkish Empire,
where some of them live in great estate, even in the Court of the
Grand Turke at Constantinople, by reason there is no Viceroy, or
Governour, or Bassa, which hath not a Iew to manage his affaires,
and to take care for his estate: Hence it cometh that in short time
they grow up to be Lords of great revenues, and they most frequently
bend the minds of Great ones to most weighty affaires in government.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greatest Viceroy of whole Europe is the Bassa of Egypt; this
Bassa always takes to him, by order of the Kingdome, a Iew with
the title of Zaraf-Bassa (<em>Thresurer</em>) viz. of all the Revenues of that
government, who receaves purses full of money, seals them, and
then sends them to the King. This man in a short time grows very
rich, for that by his hands as being next to the Bassa, the 24 Governments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>of that Empire are sould and given, and all other businesses
managed. At present he that possesseth this place, is called
S<sup>r</sup>. Abraham Alhula. The number of the Iews living in this
Kingdome of the Great Turke, is very great, and amounts to many
Millions. In Constantinople alone there are 48 Synagogues,
and in Salaminque 36, and more then fourescore thousand soules
in these two Cities alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first King gave them great priviledges which they enjoy
untill this day: for besides the liberty, they have every-where, of
trading with open shops, of bearing any Office and possessing of
any goods, both mooveable and immooveable, he yet graunted
them power to judge all Civill causes according to their own Laws
amongst themselves. Moreover they are exempted from going to
Warres, and that souldiers should be quartered in their houses, and
that Justice should take no place upon the death of any one that left
no heir to his Estate.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all which they are preferred before the naturall Turks themselves.
For which cause they pay in some Cittys to the King three
Patacons, and in others two and a half by the pole.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this estate some of the Iews have grown to great fortunes; as
Joseph Nasino, unto whom Amatus Lusitanus dedicated his fifth
and sixth Centuriæ, was by Sultan Solime made Duke of Maccia,
Earle of Andro, Seignor of Millo, and the seaven Islands: And Jacob
Ben-Iaes by Sultan Amurat, was made Governour of the Tiberiades:
so likewise others were exalted to very great and Eminent
Dignities: as was that Selomo Rose, that was sent for Ambassador
at Venice, where he confirmed the last Peace with Amurat. In Germany,
there lives also a great multitude of Jews, especially at Prague,
Vienna and Franckfurt, very much favoured by the most mild and
most gracious Emperours, but despised of the people, being a Nation
not very finely garnished by reason of their vile cloathing: yet
notwithstanding there is not wanting amongst them persons of
great quality. The Emperour Matthias made Noble both Mardochai
Mairel, and Ferdinando Jacob Bar Seba.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>But yet a greater number of Iews are found in the Kingdome of
Poland, Prussia and Lethuania, under which Monarchy they have
the Jurisdiction to judge amongst themselves all causes, both Criminal
and Civil; and also great and famous Academies of their own.
The chief Cities where the Nation liveth, are Lublin and Cracow,
where there is a Iew, called Isaac Iecells, who built a Synagogue,
which stood him in one hundred thousand Francs, and is worth many
tons of gold. There is in this place such infinite number of Iews;
that although the Cosaques in the late warres have killed of them
above one hundred and fourescore thousand; yet it is sustained that
they are yet at this day as innumerable as those were that came out
of Egypt. In that Kingdome the whole Negotiation is in the hand
of the Iews, the rest of the Christians are either all Noble-men, or
Rustiques and kept as slaves.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Italy they are generally protected by all the Princes: their principall
residence is in the most famous City of Venice; so that in that
same City alone they possesse about 1400 Houses; and are used
there with much courtesy and clemency. Many also live in Padoa
and Verona; others in Mantua, and also many in Rome it self. Finally
they are scattered here and there in the chief places of Italy, and
do live there with many speciall priviledges.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Government of the great Duke of Tuscany, they are by
that Prince most graciously &amp; bountifully dealt with, having power
from him graunted, to have their Judicatory by themselves, and
to judge in all matters, both Civill and Criminall; besides many
other Priviledges, whereof I my self have the Copies in hand. The
rich and illustrious families that flourished in these Countries are
many, viz. The Thoraces, who being three Brethren, shared betwixt
them above 700 thousand Crowns. In Ferrara were the Viles, whose
stock was above 200 thousand Crowns. The Lord Joseph de Fano,
Marquis de Villependi, was a man much respected of all the Princes
in Italy, and was called by them, The Peace-maker and appeaser
of all troubles; because he, by his authority and entremise,
was used to appease all troubles and strife rising amongst them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Don Daniel Rodrigues, because of his prudency and other good
qualities, was sent in the year 1589 from the most Excellent Senat
of Venice into Dalmatia, to appease those tumults and scandals
given by the Vsquoquibs in Clissa: which he most manly effected,
and caused all the women and children, that were kept cloose prisoners,
to be set at liberty, brought also to an happy issue many
other things of great moment, for which he was sent. Alphonso II.
the Duke of Ferrara, sent also for his Ambassador to the Imperiall
Majesty, one Abraham de Bondi, to pay and discharge Investiture
of the States of Modena and Reggio. The Prince of Sasol and
the Marquis of Scandia likewise, had to their Factors men of our
Nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Kingdome of Barbary, their lives also a great number of
Iews, who-ever cruelly and basely used by that Barbarous Nation,
except at Marrocco, the Court and Kings house, where they have
their Naguid or Prince that governs them, and is their Iudge,
and is called at this day, Seignor Moseh Palache: and before him
was in the same Court, that Noble family Ruthes, that had power
and Iurisdiction of all kinde of punishment, onely life and death
excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Low-Countries also, the Iews are received with great Charity
and Benevolency, and especially in this most renowned City
of Amsterdam, where there are no lesse then 400 Families; and
how great a trading and Negotiation they draw to that City, experience
doth sufficiently witness. They have there no lesse then
three hundred houses of their own, enjoy a good part of the West
and East-Indian Compagnies; and besides have yet to set forth their
Trafiq such a stock, that for setting a side, onely one duit of every
pound Flemish for all kind of commodities that enter, and again as
much for all what goes out of this town, and what besides we pay
yearly of the rents we get from the East-Indian Compagnie to the
reliefe and sustenance of the poore of our Synagogue, that very
money amounts ordinarily every year, unto the summe very neare
of 12000 Franks; whereby you may easely conceive what a mighty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>stock it is they trade with, and what a profit they needs must
bring into this City.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Hambourg likewise, a most famous City of Holsace in Germany,
there lives also a hundred families, protected by the Magistrat,
though molested by the people. There resides Sir Duarte Nunes
d’Acosta, Resident for his Majesty the King of Portugal: Gabriel
Gomes, Agent for his Majesty the King of Danemarck: David
de Lima, a Ieweller, for the same his Majesty; and Emanuel Boccaro
Rosales, created by the Emperour a Noble-man and a Count Palatin.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all these places the Iews live (in a manner) all of them Merchants,
and that without any prejudice at all to the Natives: For the
Natives, and those especially that are most rich, they build themselves
houses and Palaces, buy Lands and firme goods, aime at
Titles and Dignities, and so seek their rest and contentment that
way: But as for the Iews, they aspire at nothing, but to preferre
themselves in their way of Marchandize; and so employing their
<em>Capitals</em>, they send forth the benefit of their labour amongst many
and sundry of the Natives, which they, by the trafick of their Negotiation,
do enrich. From whence it’s easy to judge of the profit
that Princes and Common-wealths do reap, by giving liberty of
Religion to the Iews, and gathering them by some speciall priviledges
into their Countries: as Trees that bring forth such excellent
fruits.</p>

<p class='c007'>So that if one Prince, ill advised, driveth them out of his Land,
yet another invites them to his; &amp; shews them favour; Wherein we
may see the prophecy of Iacob fulfilled in the letter: <em>The staffe (to
support him) shall not depart from Iacob, untill Messias shall come</em>.
And this shall suffice concerning the Profit of the Iewish Nation.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h3 class='c021'><span class='large'>How Faithfull</span><br /> The Nation of the Iewes are.</h3>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The Fidelity of Vassals and Subjects, is a thing that Princes
most esteem off: for there-on, both in Peace and Warre,
depends the preservation of their estates. And as for this
point, in my opinion, they owe much to the Nation of the
Iews, by reason of the faithfulnesse and loyalty they show to all Potentates
that receive and protect them in their Countries. For setting
aside the Histories of the Ptolomies, Kings of Egypt, who did
not trust the Guard of their persons, nor the keeping of their Forts,
nor the most important affairs of their Kingdome to any other Nation
with greater satisfaction then to the Iews; the Wounds of Antipater
shewed to Iulius Cæsar in token of his loyalty, and the brasen
Tables of our Ancestours amongst the Romans, are evident witnesses
enough of their fidelity shewed unto them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Spaine the Iews of Burgos; as the Chronicles do declare, most
generously shewed the very same fidelity in the times of Don Henrique;
who having killed his Brother, the King, Don Pedro de
Cruel, made himself Lord of all his Kingdomes, and brought under
his obedience all the Grandees and people of Spaine: Only the
Iews of Burgos denyed to obey him, and fortified themselves within
the City, saying, <em>That God would never have it, that they should
deny obedience to their Naturall Lord Don Pedro, or to his rightfull successours</em>.
A constancy that the prudent King, Don Henriques, very
much esteemed of, saying, that such Vassals as those were, by Kings
and great men, worthy of much account, seeing they held greater
respect to the fidelity <em>they ought to their King, although conquered
and dead, than to the present fortune of the Conquerour</em>: And a while
after, receiving <em>very honourable conditions, they gave themselves over</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Spain also (as you may see in Mariana) many Iewes for the same
fidelity were appointed Governours of the Kingdome, and Tutors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>of Noble-mens children, jointly to others of the Nobility upon
the death of their Parents.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Chronicles of the Xarifes, dedicated to King Philip the second,
King of Spaine, alleagues for an example of great fidelity and
vertue, how the rising of the Xarifes against the Morines, their killing
and spoyling them of the Kingdome, was such a great grief unto
Samuel Alvalensi, one of those banished out of Spaine, and much
favoured by the King of Fez, descended from the house of the Morines;
that joyning himself with other Magistrates, and subjects of the
Morines, arming some ships and going himself Captain over all, he
came suddenly with 400. men, and fell by night upon the Army of
the Xarifes, that were more then 3000. men, besieging Copta, and
without losing one man, killed of them above 500. and caused
them to raise the siege.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many the like Examples may be brought of times past; but for
our present; and modern times there is no Exemple so evident, as in
the besieging of Mantua for the Emperour in the year 1630, where
the Iews fought most valiantly, and rescued it from the Natives. As
likewise in the Seignory of Brasil, where the same thing was done:
for one of the same Nation, a Dutchman, having delivered the Cape
unto the Portugals, there was found in our Nation there not only
loyalty, but also such discretion, that had they taken their advise, the
business had not so proceeded.</p>

<p class='c007'>This may be seen more clearly yet in their being banished out of
Castile, in the dayes of Ferdinand &amp; Isabella. Their number at that
time was supposed to have been half a Milion of men, amongst
whom were many of great valour, &amp; courage (as Don Isaac Abarbanel,
a Counsellor of State, doth relate) &amp; yet amongst so great a
number, there was not found any one man, that undertook to raise
a party to free themselves from that most miserable banishment. An
evident sign of the proper and naturall resolution of this Nation,
and their constant obedience to their Princes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same affection is confirmed by the inviolable custome of
all the Iews wheresoever they live: for on every Sabbath or festivall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Day, they every where are used to pray for the safety of all
Kings, Princes and Common-wealths, under whose jurisdiction
they live, of what profession-soever: unto which duty they are
bound by the Prophets and the Talmudists; from the Law, as by
Ieremie chap. 29. vers. 7. <em>Seek the peace of the City unto which I have
made you to wander: and pray for her unto the Lord, for in her Peace
you shall enjoy peace.</em> He speaks of Babylon, where the Iews at that
time were captives. From the Talmud ord. 4. tract. 4. Abodazara
pereq. 1. <em>Pray for the peace of the Kingdome, for unlesse there were
feare of the Kingdome, men would swallow one the other alive</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the continuall and never broken Custome of the Iews
wheresoever they are, on the Sabbath-Day, or other solemn Feasts;
at which time all the Iews from all places come together to the Synagogue,
after the benediction of the Holy Law, before the Minister
of the Synagogue blesseth the people of the Iews; with a loud
voice he blesseth the Prince of the Country under whom they live,
that all the Iews may hear it, and say, Amen. The words he useth
are these, as in the printed book of the Iews may be seen: <em>He that
giveth salvation unto Kings, and dominion unto Lords, he that delivered
his servant David from the sword of the Enemy, he that made a way
in the Sea, and a path in the strange waters, blesse and keep, preserve and
rescue, exalt and magnify, and lift up higher and higher, our Lord</em>.
[And then he names, the Pope, the Emperour, King, Duke, or any
other Prince under whom the Iews live, and add’s:] <em>The King of
kings defend him in his mercy, making him joyfull, &amp; free him from all
dangers and distresse. The King of kings, for his goodness sake, raise up
and exalt his planetary star, &amp; multiply his dayes over his Kingdome.
The King of kings for his mercies sake, put into his heart, and into the
heart of his Counsellers, &amp; those that attend and administer to him, that
he may shew mercy unto us, &amp; unto all the people of Israel. In his dayes
and in our dayes, let Iudah be safe, and Israel dwell securely, and let the
Redeemer come to Israel, and so may it please God. Amen.</em> These are the
very formalities set down word for word, which the Iewes, by the
command of God, received from the Talmud, do use in their prayers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>for Princes, under whose government they reside. And therefore
wise Princes are wont to banish from their Courts false reports.
And most wise <em>R. Simon Ben-Iochai</em>, in his excellent book called
<cite>Zoar</cite> in Sarasa Pecudi, relates, that <em>it is a Tradition received from
Heaven, that the Kings of the Nations of the world, Princes, Governours,
that protect the Iews in this world, or do them any good, that the
same shall enjoy certain degrees of glory, or eternall reward; as on the
other side, they that do to the Nation of the Iews any harm, that they
shall be punished with some particular eternal punishment</em>. As appeareth
also out of Esa. the last chapter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus you see the Fidelity of the Iews to wards their Governours
clearly proved. Now, that no man may think that their banishment
out of Spaign &amp; Portugal, proceeded from any suspition
or faults of theirs, I shall clearly rehearse the reason of so sudden a
determination, and what the thoughts of many Christian Princes
have been there-upon. The business was thus: Ferdinand and Isabella,
Governours of Castile, having gained the Kingdome of Granada,
of which they took possession on the fifth of Ianuary, they resolved
to thrust out all the Iews that lived in their Kingdomes, and
so on the last of March, they made an Edict in the same City, in
which they expressed: <em>That seeing the Iews in their Countries drew
many Christians to turn Iews, and especially some Noble-men of their
Kingdome of Andaluzia, that for this cause they banished them under
most heavy penalties, &amp;c.</em> So that the cause of their banishment was
not any disloyalty at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now what amongst many others in all Christendom, one famous
Lawyer in Rome, and Osorius an excellent and most eloquent Historian
have thought, I shall here relate. In the year 1492 (saith the
Lawyer) Ferdinand, called the Catholick, being King of Spain,
drove out of his Country all the Iews that were living there from
the time of the Babylonian and Roman Captivity, and were very
rich in houses and goods: and that upon pain, if they went not away
within the term of six moneths, that all their houses and
goods should be confiscated unto the Exchequer, which as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>we have said, were very great. Whereupon they leaving the Kingdome
of Castile, they went over many of them into Portugal, as being
the nearest place. In the year 1497, there being an Alliance contracted
between the Kings of Castile and Portugal; the Jews at the
request of the said King Ferdinand, were banished out of Portugal;
but it being against the will of Emanuel, King of Portugal, to have
them banished out of his Country, he resolved to oblidge them to
become Christians, promising never to molest them, neither in
Criminall matters, nor in the losse of their goods; and exempted
them from many burdens, and Tributs of the Kingdome. This Emanuel
being dead, John III, succeeded in his place in the Kingdome
of Portugal, who being excited by others, said, That what his
Father Emanuel had done, concerning the not-troubling them, was
of no valew, because they lived not as was convenient, &amp; that without
the authority of the Pope of Rome, his father could not graunt
any such thing: for which cause he would that for those that lived
amisse, they should be proceeded against, as against the Mores in
Castile: And sending to Rome to disanull the said promises, it was
not onely not graunted to him, but moreover they reprooved his
appearance there, and praised and approoved the promises made
by his Father Emanuel to the Jewes, publishing a generall pardon to
all that were taken, which were about 1500, and they all were set
free. Which Bull was graunted by Clement VII. by the intervention
of all the Consistory of Cardinals. Afterwards the said king
John sent once again to desire the former Licence with so many replications
and triplications, that at length the Pope granted it: But
a few daies after it was revoked again with a generall Pardon to all
that were taken, which were 12000, with such a determination,
that the same Licence should never be graunted, as being against all
right and reason. This troubled Don John the King very much,
and withall the Cardinal his brother, who came in these last dayes
to be King of Portugal himself. Great Paul III. of the house of
Farnesia, succeeding to Clement the VII. there was a request rendred
to the Pope for power to bring in the Inquisition into this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Kingdome. The Pope would not graunt it, saying: He could not,
and that it was a thing against reason and Iustice, but on the contrary
confirmed the promises made by the King Don Emanuel, his
Father; and pardoned all the delinquents since the time of violence
unto that day. Don Iohn seeing this, sent an Embassadour
meerly for that businesse to the Pope, but could obtain nothing at
all: for which cause King Iohn resolved to entreat the Emperour
Charles the V. then passing for Rome, as Conquerour over the
Turks, having wonn Tunis and Goleta, that in this his Triumph
he would take occasion to desire this favour from the Pope, that
the King of Portugal might set up the Inquisition in his Kingdome,
it being an old custome that those that triumphed, should aske
something of the Pope that they most desired. The Emperour than
having desired this, the Pope answered him, that he could not do
it by reason of the agreement made, and the promises of the King
Don Emanuel; which he had found by an Apostolicall Nuntio in
Portugal in the year 1497, at which time the Iewes were forced
and compelled to become Christians. The Emperour replyed, Let
that sinne fall on him, and the Prince his sonne, the Apostolicall
seat shall be free from it. So the Pope graunted it; because the Emperour
Charles the V. was brother in law to King Don Iohn of
Portugal; and besides they treated at that time to enter further in affinity,
and to marry their children, which since was effected. After
Paul the III. graunted this, there was a new Pardon given in generall
to all that were taken unto that time, amounting the Number
unto 1800. But the King refusing to obey the Pardon, and to
free the Prisonners, the Pope tooke it very ill, and sent for this
onely businesse for his Nuntio, one Monsegnor Monte Paliciano,
who since was Cardinal of the Church of Rome. And
the King for all this not obeying, the Pope made the Nuntio to
fix the Pardon upon the doores of the Cathedrall Churches,
and the Nuntio caused the Prisons to be opened, and there were
set free about 1800 prisoners. He that sollicited this businesse
at Rome was one Seignor Duarte de Paz, a Cavallier of the Order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>of St. Iohn: whom to search out there were appointed at Rome ten
men disguised; these having found him, gave him fifteen wounds,
and left him for dead: thus wounded, he was carried to the house
of Seignor Philip Estrozi: This being reported to the Pope,
Paul the III. he caused him to be carried to the Castle of S. Angelo,
where he gave order to have him nobly cured. That same Seignor
was by the Pope, by all the Cardinals and the whole Court in
great respect. At the same time that this man was hurt, the Emperour
Charles the V. was at Rome with his Army. On the time
when he began to treat of this businesse with Clement the VII. seeing
the Kings importunity, he made a Bull and gave licence to all
the Portugals of that Nation of the Iews; that they might go and
live in the Church-Dominions, &amp; whosoever will come in the said
Dominions, that he shall have freedom to live, as at the first, in his
Iewish profession, and that at no time they should be enquired into,
but after the same manner as they were wont to live in Portugal, so
they should live there. The said Bull passed all the Consistory; and
being confirmed and received by the said Portugals, they began
some of them to depart to live in Ancona, being a sea-port more
commodious then others: which being known by the King and
Cardinal of Portugal, they caused to be proclaimed in all the Kingdome,
that upon paine of death, and losse of all their goods, no
man should dare depart the Kingdome. Clement being dead, in his
place succeeded (as we have said) Pope Paul the III. who confirmed
the same Priviledges: Afterwards in the year 1550. Paul the
III. died, and Julius the III. succeeded, who ratified the fore-mentioned
Priviledges given by his Predecessours, and the whole Apostolike
Seat inviolably. In those times there were many Doctors that
wrote on this matter, amongst whom the chiefest were Alciat, and
the Cardinal Parisius in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">2 &amp; 3 parte Consiliorum pro Christianis noviter
conversis</span></i>; shewing by reason and law, that considering they
were forced and not converted willingly, that they had not fallen
nor do fall under any Censure. These reasons being considered of
by the Princes of Italy, they graunted likewise the same Priviledges:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>viz. Cosmo the Great, Duke of Florence, and Hercules, Duke of
Ferrare, and within few years Emanuel Felibert, Duke of Savoye;
and were by all his successours confirmed. In the year 1492, when
they were banished from Castile, we read in the Chronicles of that
Kingdome, that the Lords of that place did complain that their Cities
and Towns were destroyed and dis-inhabitated; and had they
believed any such thing, that they would have opposed the Kings
decree, and would never have given their consent to it. That
was the cause, that Don Emanuel of Portugal, seeing on the one
side apparent dammage, should he let them depart his Kingdome;
and on the otherside, not being able to break his promise
made to the King of Castile, he caused them to be compelled
to the Faith, upon paine of Death, that they should not
depart out of his Dominions. The Catholiq King was blamed
of all Christian Princes, and especially by the Senate of Venice,
(as Marcus Antonius Sabellicus doth write) for having banished
a Nation so profitable to the Publicq and Particular good,
without any kind of pretence. And so the Parliament of Paris likewise
did extreamly wonder at such a determination. And truely
good reason there was to wonder; for we see since, what the Senat
of Venice hath done, who never deliberats or puts into execution
any thing, without great judgement: having the advantage of all
Republicqs in their Government and leaving behind them
the Romans, Carthagenians, Athenians, and most learned Lacedemonians,
and that Parliament of Paris, which in the Government
of affaires was alwayes most prudent. Most of those
that were banished passed to the Levant, who were embraced by
the Ottoman-family, all the succeeding Kings wondring at it, that
the Spanjards, who make profession to be a politiq Nation, should
drive out of their kingdomes such a people. Moreover Sultan
Bajazet, and Sultan Soliman, received them exceeding well, the
coming of the Iews to them being very acceptable: and so did likewise
all their successours, considering of how great a profit and benefit
their residing in their Dominions was. And in the year 1555.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Paul the IV. being chosen Pope of Rome, who before was called
Cardinal de Chiesi, an intimate to the Cardinal of Portugal, caused
the Iewes to be held in Ancona, &amp; other places of the Church,
according to the Priviledges graunted to them by the Popes, his
Predecessours in the name of the Apostolical Roman seat. Licurgus,
Solon and Draco, and all Founders of Commonwealths, gave
counsell that strangers ought to be loved and much made of, as in
the Discourses of <em>Se. in 7 de Legibus de Rep.</em> is amply to be seen. And
by the Divine Law (as Moses commanded us) we ought not to
trouble a stranger, but he sayes, <em>Remember you were strangers in the
Land of Egypt</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In summe, to the same purpose might be brought many other
and more powerfull reasons, but because they are out of our consideration,
we passe them over. And here to declare some particulars,
worthy to be known for advise and example, that befell our
Nation in those bitter banishments; part whereof Hieronymus Osorius
recites more at large, in the first of his elegant two Books de
Rebus Emanuelis. The first title he giveth to those miserable successes,
is this, which he puts for a Postil in the margent of his booke,
<em>Iudæorum Liberi pervim ad Christianismum pertracti</em>: and than rehearses,
how that in the year 1496 the King decreed, that all the
Iewes and Mores, that dwelt in his Kingdome, and would not become
Christians, should depart his Dominions in a short time;
which being past, all that should be found in his Kingdome, should
loose their liberty, and become slaves to the King. The time being
now at hand (as Osorius proceeds) in which the Iewes, that would
not turne Christians, were to depart the Kingdome, and all of them
as many as they were, had with all their power provided, and taken
a firme resolution to be gone: which the King seeing, and not able
to endure it, thought upon a businesse (as he saith) <em>facto quidem iniquam
&amp; injustam</em>, which to do was really wicked and unjust, and
that was to command that all the children of the Israelites, that
were not above 14 years old, should be taken out of the power of
their own Parents; &amp; when they had them, they should force them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>to become Christians; a new thing that could not be done without
a wonderfull alteration of their minds: for it was (as Osorius speaks)
a horrid and miserable spectacle, to see the tender Infants wrestled
out of the arms and brests of their lamenting mothers, to dragge along
their poore fathers that held them fast, and to give them
many wounds and blows to draw them out of their handes; to hear
their cryes that ascend to heaven, their groanes, lamentations, and
complaints every-where, so that this cruelty was the cause, that
many of those distressed Fathers threw their children into wells,
and others killed themselves with their own hands, that they might
not see so bitter a thing with their eyes. The cruelty of Emanuel ended
not here, but going on with compulsion and revilings, gave
cause to his owne Chronographer to make the second title or postil,
with these words; <em>Vis &amp; Dolus Iudæisillata</em>: That is, The force
and deceit used towards the Iewes. And so he goes on, declaring
how he had promised in the condition they had made, that he
would assigne them three Ports in his Kingdome to embarque at,
viz. Lisbon, Setuval, and Puerto: and neverthelesse he forbad them
afterwards to embarque themselves in any place but Lisbon: for
which cause all the Iewes of the Kingdome came to that City, from
whence besides a thousand molestations and extortions, he drove
them (as Vasquo saith) as sheep in the stalls, and there forced
their afflicted bodies to counterfeit, that which their soules and
thoughts never meant nor approoved of. Works, of which his
own Chronologer saith, <em>Fuit hoc quidem neque ex Lege, neque ex
religione factum</em>. That is, This was done neither according to Law,
nor Religion. Let men of clear mind, and free from passion consider
for Gods sake, if such violences can work any good impression
or character in men: or what Law, either Humain or Divine,
National or Modern, can bear, that the souls of men (which the
Most High hath created free) be forced to believe what they believe
not, and to love what they hate? This cruelty was reproved
and censure of many Princes of the world and learned men. And
his own Chronologer reprehends it with a new postil, and speaks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>freely; <em>Regis in Iudæos facinorum reprehensio</em>. That is, A censure
of the Kings wickednesse against the Iews. Truely with just reason
doth Osorius call the works, which the King did unto us, <em>Iniquities
and injustices, deceitfull violences, and wicked attempts</em>: and so
goes on, reproving them with most elegant Reasons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further what happened to the Iews under other Princes in other
Kingdomes and Countries, is notorious and enough known to
all the world, and therefore not necessary here to relate. So farre
concerning their Bannishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, I will not conceale to say, but that alwayes there
have bene found some calumniators, that endeavouring to
make the Nation infamous, laid upon them <em>three most false reports</em>,
as if <em>they were dangerous to the Goods, the Lives</em>, and withall
to <em>the very Souls of the Natives</em>. They urge against them their <em>usuries</em>,
the <em>slaying of infants</em> to celebrate their Passe-over, and the
<em>inducing Christians to become Iews</em>. To all which I shall answer
briefly.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. As for <em>usury</em>, such dealing is not the essential property of the
Iews, for though in Germany there be some indeed that practise
usury; yet the most part of them that live in Turky, Italy, Holland
and Hamburg, being come out of Spaigne, they hold it infamous
to use it; and so with a very small profit of 4. or 5. per Cent, as Christians
themselves do, they put their money ordinarily in Banco:
for to lay out their money without any profit, was commanded only
toward their brethren of the same Nation of the Iews; but not to
any other Nation. And however by this Charity is not hurt: for
it stands in good reason, that every one<a id='t100'></a> should gain and get some
advantage with his money, to sustaine his own life: and when any
one to supply his own wants, doth take some course of Marchandise,
by which he hopes to gaine by other mens moneys taken up
on trust, ’tis no inhumanity to reckon and take from him
use: For as no man is bound to give his goods to an other; so is
he not bound to let it out, but for his own occasions and profit,
and not to leave himself destitute of the profit he could make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>of the monyes. Onely this must be done with moderation, that the
usury be not biting and exorbitant, which the Christians themselves
use, amongst themselves; as even in the Mounts of Piety at Padua,
Vicenza and Verona is to be seen, where they take 6 per<a id='t101'></a> Cent, and
elsewhere yet much more. This in no manner can be called Robbery,
but is with consent and will of the Contracter; and the same Sacred
Scripture, which allows usury with him that is not of the same
Religion, forbids absolutely the robbing of all men, whatsoever
Religion they be of. In our Law it is a greater sinne to rob or defraud
a stranger, than if I did it to one of my own profession: because
a Jew is bound to shew his charity to all men: for he hath a
precept, not to abhorre an Idumean, nor an Egyptian; and that he
shall love and protect a stranger that comes to live in his land. If notwithstanding
there be some that do contrary to this, they do it not
as Iewes simply, but as wicked Iewes, as amongst all nations there
are found generally some Usurers.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. As for <em>killing of the young children of Christians</em>; it is an infallible
truth what is reported of the Negros of Guinea and Brazil, that if
they see any miserable man that hath escaped from the danger of the
sea, or hath fallen or suffered any kind of ill-fortune, or Shipwrake,
they persecute and vex him so much the more, saying, <em>God curse thee</em>.
And wee that live not amongst the Blacke-moors and wild-men,
but amongst the white and civilized people of the world, yet wee
find this an ordinary course, that men are very prone to hate and
despise him that hath ill fortune; and on the other side, to make
much of those whom fortune doth favour. Hereof the Christians
themselves have good experience; for during the times of their suppression
and persecution under the Roman Empire, they were falsely
slandred of divers Emperours and tyrannicall Princes. Nero
accused them, that they had set Rome on fire; Others, that
they were Witches and Conjurers; and others againe that
they slew their children to celebrate their Ceremonies, as wee
find in divers Authors. Even so likewise it is with the Jewish
Nation, that now is dispersed and afflicted, though they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>moneys: There is no slander nor calumny that is not cast upon
them, even the very same ancient scandall that was cast of old upon
the innocent Christians, is now laid upon the Jews. Whereas the
whole world may easely perceive, it is but a meer slander, seeing
it is known that at this day, out of Jerusalem, no sacrifice nor blood
is in any use by them, even that blood which is found in an Egg is
forbidden them, how much more mans blood? Moreover I could
produce divers memorable examples which out in our own times
in Araguza to a Jew: how he was accused of this same wickedness,
and not confessing it, how they imprisoned him betwixt to walls,
and being in that distresse, how he cited before God all the Judges
to answer there for what they did; and how within a year after,
many of the Iudges died, and those that lived, fearing the like might
befall them, and loose their lives, set him free: But I must not be too
prolix; it may suffice to say, that by the Pope himself it was defined
in full Counsell the accusation to be false; and so likewise judged
all the Princes of Italy; as also Alphonso the Wise, King of Spain,
and that it was onely a meer invention to drink the blood, and to
swallow up the goods of the harmlesse Iews.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. As for the <em>third</em> Point, I say, that although Ferdinand &amp; Isabell,
giving colour to so indiscreet a determination, said, that they
induced the Nobles to become Iews, yet truely this cannot be said,
but by some false informations. For if so be, amongst those difficulties
and impossibilities, it may happen, that some of the Sect of
the Papists, of a better mind, embrace the Iewish Religion; it cannot
therefore be presumed, that they were induced thereunto by
the Iews; seeing the Iews do not entice any man to professe their
Law: But if any man of his own free-will come to them, they by
their rites &amp; Ceremonies are obliged to make proof of them, whether
they come for any temporall interest, and to persuade them to
look well to themselves what they do: that the Law unto which
they are to submit themselves, is of many precepts; and doth oblige
the transgressor to many sore punishments. And so we follow
the example of Nahomi, cited in the Sacred Scripture, who did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>not persuade Ruth to go along with her; but said first to her: <em>Orpa
thy sister returned to her Nation and her Gods; go thou and follow her</em>.
But Ruth continuing constant, then at length she received her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides this, the Iews indeed have reason to take care for their
own preservation; and therefore will not go about by such wayes
to make themselves odious to Princes and Common-wealths, under
whose Dominions they live.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, because I beleive, that with a good conscience I have discharged
our Nation of the Iews of those three slanders or calumnies,
as elsewhere I have more at large written about it; I conceive
I may from those two qualities, of Profitablenesse and Fidelity conclude,
that such a Nation ought to be well entertained, and also beloved
and protected generally of all. The more, considering they
are called in the Sacred Scriptures, the Sons of God; and ’tis said
by all the Prophets, that they who shall wrong them, shall be most
severely punished; and that he that toucheth them, toucheth the
apple of Gods eye. And at least, it was alwayes the opinion of Augustine,
as he made it appear in his works <em>Libr. de Doctrina Christiana
cap.</em> 28. where he saith, <em>Quod omnes homines æque diligendi
sunt</em>. That all men are equally to be beloved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, having proved the two former Points. I could adde a third,
viz. of the Nobility of the Iews: but because that Point is enough
known amongst all Christians, as lately yet it hath been most
worthily and excellently shewed and described in a certain Book,
called, <em>The Glory of Iehudah and Israel</em>, dedicated to our Nation by
that worthy Christian Minister Mr. <em>Henry Iessey</em>, (1653. in Duch)
where this matter is set out at large: And by Mr. <em>Edw. Nicholas</em>
Genleman, in his Book, called, <em>An Apologie for the Honorable Nation
of the Iews, and all the Sons of Israel</em> (1648. in English.) Therefore
I will here forbeare, and rest on their saying of our King Salomon,
the wisest on earth, <em>Let another mans mouth praise thee, and
not thine own</em>. Which is the close of <em>Rabbi Menesse Ben-Israel</em>,
a Divine, and Doctor in Physick, in the <em>Strand</em> over against the
<em>New-Exchange</em> in <em>London</em>.</p>

I have received a letter from your worship, which
was welcome to me; and I read it, because yours,
with great delight; if you will please to allow for
the unpleasantnesse of the subject. For I do assure
your worship, I never met with any thing in
my life which I did more deeply resent, for that it
reflecteth upon the credit of a nation, which amongst so many
calumnies, so manifest, (and therefore shamefull) I dare to pronounce
innocent. Yet I am afraid, that whilst I answer to them,
I shall offend some, whose zeal will not permit them to consider,
that self vindication, as defensive armes, is naturall to all; but to
be wholly silent, were to acknowledge what is so falsly objected.
Wherefore that I may justifie my self to my own conscience, I
have obeyed your worships commands: for your request must
not be accounted lesse, at least by me. I presume your worship
cannot expect either prolix, or polite discourses upon so sad a
subject; for who can be ambitious in his own calamity? I have
therefore dispatcht onely some concise, and brief relations, barely
exceeding the bounds of a letter; yet such as may suffice you,
to inform the Rulers of the <em>English</em> nation, of a truth most reall,
and sincere; which I hope they will accept in good part, according
to their noble, and singular prudence and piety. For innocencie
being alwayes most free from suspecting evil, I cannot be perswaded,
that any one hath either spoken, or written against us,
out of any particular hatred that they bare us, but that they rather
supposed our coming might prove prejudiciall to their estates,
and interests; charity alwayes beginning at home. Yet
notwithstanding I propounded this matter under an argument of
profit (for this hath made us welcome in other countries) and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>therefore I hope I may prove what I undertake. However, I have
but small encouragement to expect the happy attainment of any
other design, but onely that truth may be justified of her
children. I shall answer in order to what your worship hath proposed.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE FIRST SECTION.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>And in the first place, I cannot but weep bitterly, and with
much anguish of soul lament that strange and horrid accusation
of some Christians against the dispersed, and afflicted
<em>Iewes</em> that dwell among them, when they say (what I tremble
to write) that the <em>Iewes</em> are wont to celebrate the feast of unleavened
bread, fermenting it with the bloud of some Christians,
whom they have for this purpose killed: when the calumniators
themselves have most barbarously and cruelly butchered some
of them. Or to speak more mildly, have found one dead,
and cast the corps, as if it had been murdered by the <em>Iewes</em>, into
their houses or yards, as lamentable experience hath proved in
sundry places: and then with unbridled rage and tumult, they accuse
the innocent <em>Iews</em>, as the committers of this most execrable
fact. Which detestable wickednesse hath been sometimes perpetrated,
that they might thereby take advantage to exercise their
cruelty upon them; and sometimes to justifie, and patronize their
massacres already executed. But how farre this accusation is
from any semblable appearance of truth, your worship may judge
by these following arguments.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. It is utterly forbid the <em>Iewes</em> to eat any manner of bloud
whatsoever, <em>Levit.</em> Chapter 7.26. and <em>Deuter.</em> 12. where it is expresly
said <span lang='iw' xml:lang='ar' dir='rtl'>וכל דם</span> <em>And ye shall eat no manner of bloud</em>, and in obedience
to this command the <em>Iewes</em> eat not the bloud of any animal.
And more then this, if they find one drop of bloud in an
egge, they cast it away as prohibited. And if in eating a piece of
bread, it happens to touch any bloud drawn from the teeth, or
gummes, it must be pared, and cleansed from the said bloud, as
it evidenely appeares in <em>Sulhan Haruch</em> and our rituall book.
Since then it is thus, how can it enter into any mans heart to believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>that they should eat humane bloud, which is yet more detestable,
there being scarce any nation now remaining upon
earth so barbarous, as to commit such wickednesse?</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The precept in the Decalogue <em>Thou shalt not kill</em> is of generall
extent; it is a morall command. So that the <em>Iewes</em> are bound
not onely, not to kill one of those nations where they live, but
they are also oblig’d by the law of gratitude, to love them. They
are the very words of R. <em>Moses</em> of <em>Egypt</em> in <em>Iad a Razaka</em>, in his
treatise of Kings, the tenth Chapter, in the end, <em>Concerning the nations,
the ancients have commanded us to visit their sick and to bury their
dead, as the dead of Israel, and to relieve, and maintain their poor, as we
do the poor of Israel, because of the wayes of peace, as it is written,
God is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works</em>. Psal.
145.9. And in conformity hereto, I witnesse before God blessed
for ever, that I have continually seen in <em>Amsterdam</em> where I reside,
abundance of good correspondency, many interchanges of
brotherly affection, and sundry things of reciprocall love. I
have thrice seen when some <em>Flemine</em> Christians have fallen into
the river in our ward, called <em>Flemburgh</em>, our nation cast themselves
into the river to them, to help them out, and to deliver
their lives from death. And certainly he that will thus hazard
himself to save another, cannot harbour so much cruell malice,
as to kill the innocent, whom he ought out of the duty of humanity
to defend and protect.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. It is forbidden <em>Exodus</em> 21.20. to kill a stranger; <em>If a man
smite his servant, or his maid with a rod, and he die under his hand, he
shall surely be punished, notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he
shall not be punished, for he is his money</em>. The text speaks of a servant
that is one of the Gentile nations, because that he onely is said to
be the <em>money</em> of the <em>Iew</em>, who is his master, as <em>Aben Ezra</em> well notes
upon the place. And the Lord commands, that if he die under
the hand of his master, his master shall be put to death, for that as
it seems, he struck him with a murderous intent. But it is otherwise
if the servant dies afterwards, for then it appeares, that he did not
strike him with a purpose to kill him; for if so, he would have killed
him out of hand, wherefore he shall be free, and it may suffice for
punishment that he hath lost his money. If therefore a <em>Iew</em> cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>kill his servant, or slave that is one of the nations, according to
the law, how much lesse shall he be impowred to murder him
that is not his <em>enemy</em>, and with whom he leads a quiet and a peaceable
life? and therefore how can any good man believe that
against his holy law, a <em>Iew</em> (in a strange countrey especially)
should make himself guilty of so execrable a fact?</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Admit that it were lawfull (which God forbid) why should
they eat the bloud? And supposing they should eat the bloud,
why should they eat it on the Passeover? Here at this feast, every
confection ought to be so pure, as not to admit of any leaven,
or any thing that may fermentate, which certainly bloud doth.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. If the <em>Iewes</em> did repute, and hold this action (which is never
to be named without an epethite of horrour) necessary, they
would not expose themselves to so eminent a danger, to so cruell
and more deserved punishment, unlesse they were moved to
it by some divine precept; or at least, some constitution of their
wise men. Now we challenge all those men who entertain this
dreadfull opinion of us, as obliged in point of justice, to cite the
place of Scripture, or of the Rabbins, where any such precept, or
doctrine is delivered. And untill they do so, we will assume so
much liberty, as to conclude it to be no better then a malicious
slander.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. If a man, to save his life, may break the Sabbath, and transgresse
many of the other commands of the law, as hath been
determined in the Talmud; as also confirmed by R. <em>Moses</em> of <em>Egypt</em>,
in the fifth Chapter of his treatise of the fundamentalls of
the law; yet three are excepted, which are, <em>idolatry</em>, <em>murther</em>, and
<em>adultery</em>; life not being to be purchased at so dear a rate, as the committing
of these heinous sins: an innocent death being infinitely
to be preferred before it. Wherefore if the killing of a Christian,
as they object, were a divine precept, and institution, (which far
be it from me to conceive) it were certainly to be null’d and rendred
void, since a man cannot perform it, without indangering
his own life; and not onely so, but the life of the whole congregation
of an entire people; and yet more, since it is directly a violation
of one of these three precepts, <em>Thou shalt do no murder</em>:
which is intended universally of all men, as we have said before.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>7. The Lord, blessed for ever, by his prophet <em>Ieremiah</em> Chap.
29.7. gives it in command to the captive Israelites that were dispersed
among the heathens, that they should continually pray
for, and endeavour the peace, welfare and prosperity of the city
wherein they dwelt, and the inhabitants thereof. This the <em>Iewes</em>
have alwayes done, and continue to this day in all their Synagogues,
with a particular blessing of the Prince or Magistrate, under
whose protection they live. And this the Right Honourable
my Lord <em>St. Iohn</em> can testifie; who when he was Embassadour to
the Lords the States of the united Provinces, was pleased to honour
our Synagogue at <em>Amsterdam</em> with his presence, where our
nation entertained him with musick, and all expressions of joy and
gladnesse, and also pronounced a blessing, not onely upon his
honour, then present, but upon the whole Common-wealth of
<em>England</em>, for that they were a people in league and amity; and because
we conceived some hopes that they would manifest towards
us, what we ever bare towards them, <em>viz.</em> all love and affection.
But to return again to our argument, if we are bound to study,
endeavour, and sollicite, the good and flourishing estate of the
city where we live, and the inhabitants thereof, how shall we then
murder their children, who are the greatest good, and the most
flourishing blessing that this life doth indulge to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. The children of Israel are naturally mercifull, and full of
compassion. This was acknowledged by their enemies, <em>Kings</em> 1.20,
31. when <em>Benhadad</em> King of <em>Assyria</em> was discomfited in the
battel, and fled away, he became a petitioner for his life to King
<em>Ahab</em>, who had conquered him; for he understood that <em>the Kings
of the house of Israel were mercifull Kings</em>; and his own experience
confirmed it, when for a little affection that he pretended in a
complement, he obtained again his life and fortunes, from which
the event of the warre had disentitled him. And when the
<em>Gibeonites</em> made that cruell request to <em>David</em>, that seven of <em>Saul’s</em><a id='t111'></a>
sons who were innocent, should be delivered unto them, the prophet
saies, <em>now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel</em>, Sam.
2.21, 2. as if he had said, in this cruelty, the piety of the Israelites
is not so much set forth, as the tyranny, and implacable rage
of the Gentiles, the <em>Gibeonites</em>. Which being so, and experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>withall declares it, <em>viz.</em> the fidelity which our nation hath inviolably
preserved towards their superiours, then most certainly it
is wholly incompatible, and inconsistent with the murdering of
their children.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. There are some Christians, that use to insult against the <em>Iewes</em>,
as Christian homicides, that will venter to give a reason of these
pretended murtherous practises. As if the accusation were then
most infallibly true, if they can find any semblance of a reason
why it might be so. As they say, that this is practised by them in
hatred and detestation of Jesus of Nazareth. And that therefore
they steal Christian Children, buffeting them in the same manner
that he was buffetted; thereby to rub up, and revive the memory
of the aforesaid death. And likewise they imagine that the
<em>Iewes</em> secretly steal away crosses, crucifixes, and such like graven
images, which Papists privately and carefully retein in their houses,
and every day the <em>Iewes</em> mainly strike, and buffet, shamefully
spitting on them, with such like ceremonies of despight, and all
this in hatred of Jesus. But I admire what they really think, when
they object such things as these, laying them to our charge. For
surely we cannot believe, that a people, otherwise of sufficient prudence,
and judgement, can perswade themselves into an opinion
that the <em>Iewes</em> should commit such practises, unlesse they
could conceive they did them in honour and obedience to the
God whom they worship. And what kind of obedience is this
they perform to God blessed for ever, when they directly sin against
that speciall command <em>Thou shalt not kill</em>? Besides, this cannot
be committed without the imminent, and manifest perill of
their lives and fortunes, and the necessary exposing themselves to
a just revenge. Moreover, it is an <em>Anathema</em> to a <em>Iew</em> to have any
graven images in his house, or any thing of an idol, which any of
the nations figuratively worship, <em>Deut.</em> 7.26.</p>

<p class='c007'>10. <em>Matthew Paris</em> p. 532. writes, how that in the year 1240.
the <em>Iewes</em> circumcised a Christian child at <em>Norwich</em>, and gave him
the name <em>Iurnin</em>, and reserved him to be crucified, for which cause
many of them were most cruelly put to death. The truth of this
story will evidently appear upon the consideration of its circumstances.
He was first circumcised, and this perfectly constitutes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>him a <em>Iew</em>. Now for a <em>Iew</em> to embrace a Christian in his armes,
and foster him in his bosome, is a testimony of great love and
affection. But if it was intended that shortly after this child
should be crucified, to what end was he first circumcised? If it
shall be said it was out of hatred to the Christians, it appears rather
to the contrary, that it proceeded from detestation of
the <em>Iewes</em>, or of them who had newly become proselytes, to embrace
the <em>Iewes</em> religion. Surely this supposed pranck (storied
to be done in popish times) looks more like a piece of the reall
scene of the Popish <em>Spaniards</em> piety, who first baptiz’d the poor
<em>Indians</em>, and afterwards out of cruel pity to their souls, inhumanely
butchered them; then of strict-law-observing <em>Iewes</em>, who dare
not make a sport of one of the seales of their covenant.</p>

<p class='c007'>11. Our captivity under the Mahumetans is farre more burdensome,
and grievous then under the Christians, and so our ancients
have said, <em>it is better to inhabit under Edom then Ismael</em>, for they
are a people more civill, and rationall, and of a better policie, as
our nation have found experimentally. For, excepting the nobler,
and better sort of <em>Iewes</em>, such as live in the Court of <em>Constantinople</em>,
the vulgar people of the <em>Iewes</em> that are dispersed in other
countries of the Mahumetan Empire, in <em>Asia</em> and <em>Africa</em>, are treated
with abundance of contempt and scorn. It would therefore
follow, that if this sacrificing of children be the product and result
of hatred, that they should execute and disgorge it much
more upon the Mahumetans, who have reduced them to so great
calamity and misery. So that if it be necessary to the celebration of
the Passeover, why do they not as well kill a <em>Mahumetan</em>? But although
the <em>Iewes</em> are scattered, and dispersed throughout all
those vast territories, notwithstanding all their despite against us,
they never yet to this day forged such a calumnious accusation.
Wherefore it appeares plainly, that it is nothing else but a slander,
and such a one, that considering how the scene is laid, I cannot easily
determine whether it speak more of malice, or of folly: certainly
Sultan <em>Selim</em> made himself very merry with it, when the
story was related him by <em>Moses Amon</em> his chief Physicyan.</p>

<p class='c007'>12. If all that which hath been said is not of sufficient force to
wipe off this accusation, because the matter on our part is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>purely negative, and so cannot be cleared by evidence of witnesses,
I am constrained to use another way of argument, which
the Lord, blessed for ever, hath prescribed <em>Exod.</em> 22. which is an
oath; wherefore I swear, without any deceit or fraud, by the most
high God, the creatour of heaven and earth, who promulged his
law to the people of Israel, upon mount <em>Sinai</em>, that I never yet to
this day saw any such custome among the people of Israel, and
that they doe not hold any such thing by divine precept of the
law, or any ordinance or institution of their wise men, and that
they never committed or endeavoured such wickednesse, (that I
know, or have credibly heard, or read in any Jewish Authours)
and if I lie in this matter, then let all the curses mentioned in <em>Leviticus</em>
and <em>Deuteronomy</em> come upon me, let me never see the blessings
and consolations of Zion, nor attain to the resurrection of
the dead. By this I hope I may have proved what I did intend, and
certainly this may suffice all the friends of truth, and all faithfull
Christians to give credit to what I have here averred. And indeed
our adversaries who have been a little more learned, and
consequently a little more civill then the vulgar, have made a halt
at this imputation. <em>Iohn Hoornbeek</em> in that book which he lately
writ against our nation, wherein he hath objected against us, right
or wrong, all that he could any wayes scrape together, was notwithstanding
ashamed to lay this at our door, in his <cite>Prolegomena</cite>
pag. 26. where he sayes, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">An autem verum fit quod vulgò in historiis legatur,
&amp;c.</span></i> <em>i.e.</em> whether that be true which is commonly read in histories,
to aggravate the <em>Iewes</em> hatred against the Christians, or rather
the Christians against the <em>Iewes</em>, that they should annually
upon the preparation of the Passeover, after a cruell manner sacrifice
a Christian child, privily stollen, in disgrace, and contempt
of Christ, whose passion, and crucifixion the Christians celebrate,
I will not assert for truth; as well knowing, how easy it was for
those times wherein these things are mentioned, to have happen’d,
(especially after the Inquisition was set up in the Popedome)
to forge, and fain; and how the histories of those ages, according
to the affection of the writers, were too too much addicted,
and given unto fables and figments. Indeed I have never
yet seen any of all those relations that hath by any certain experiment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>proved this fact, for they are all founded; either upon
the uncertain report of the vulgar, or else upon the secret accusation
of the Monks belonging to the inquisition, not to mention
the avarice of the informers, wickedly hanquering after the <em>Iewes</em>
wealth, and so with ease forging any wickednesse. For in the first
book of the <em>Sicilian</em> constitutions tit. 7. we see the Emperour
<em>Frederick</em> saying, <em>Sivero Iudæus, vel Saracenus fit, in quibus prout certò
perpendimus Christianorum persecutio minus abundat ad præsens</em>, but
if he be a <em>Iew</em> or a <em>Saracen</em>, against whom, as we have weighed,
the persecution of the Christians do much abound, <em>&amp;c.</em> thus
taxing the violence of certain Christians against the <em>Iewes</em>. Or if
perhaps it hath sometimes happened, that a Christian was kill’d
by a <em>Iew</em>, we must not therefore say that in all places where they
inhabit, they annually kill a Christian Child. And for that which
<em>Thomas Cantipratensis</em> lib. 2. cap. 23. affirms, <em>viz.</em> that it is certainly
known, that the <em>Iewes</em> every year, in every province, cast lots what
city or town shall afford Christian bloud to the other cities. I can
give it no more credit then his other fictions and lies wherewith
he hath stuffed his book. Thus farre <em>Iohn Hoornbeek</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>13. Notwithstanding all this, there are not wanting some histories,
that relate these and the like calumnies against an afflicted
people, For which cause the Lord saith, <em>He that toucheth you toucheth
the apple of my eye</em>, Zach. 2.6. I shall cursolarily mention some
passages that have occurred in my time, whereof, I say not that I
was an eye witnesse, but onely that they were of generall report
and credence, without the least contradiction. I have faithfully
noted both the names of the persons, the places where, and the
time when they happened, in my continuation of <em>Flavius Josephus</em>,
I shall be the lesse curious therefore in reciting them here. In <em>Vienna</em>
the Metropolis of <em>Austria</em>, <em>Frederick</em> being Emperour, there
was a pond frozen, according to the cold of those parts, wherein
three boyes (as it too frequently happens) were drowned. when
they were missed, the imputation is cast upon the <em>Jewes</em>, and
they are incontinently indicted, for murthering of them, to celebrate
their Passeover. And being imprisoned, after infinite prayers
and supplications made to no effect, three hundred of them
were burnt, when the pond thawd, these three boyes were found,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>and then their innocency was clearly evinc’d although too late,
after the execution of this cruelty.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <em>Araguza</em> about thirty yeares ago, there was a Christian woman,
into whose house there came a little girle (of eleven yeares
of age, daughter to a neighbouring gentleman) richly adorned
with jewels: this wretched woman, not thinking of a safer way to
rob her, then by killing her, cut her throat, and hid her under
her bed, the girle was presently mist, and by information they
understood that she was seen to go into that house, they call a
Magistrate to search the house, and find the girle dead, she confest
the fact, and as if she should have expiated her own guilt by
destroying a <em>Iew</em>, though never so innocent, she said, she did it
at the instigation and perswasion of one <em>Isaac Jeshurun</em>, for that
the <em>Jewes</em> wanted bloud to celebrate their feast: she was hang’d,
and the <em>Jew</em> was apprehended, who being six times cruelly tortur’d,
they employing their wits in inventing unheard of, and insufferable
torments, such as might gain <em>Perillous</em> the estimation
of mercifull and compassionate, still cryes out of the falshood of
the accusation, saying, that that wickednesse which he never committed,
no not so much as in his dreams, was maliciously imputed
to him, yet notwithstanding he was condemned to remain close
prisoner for twenty yeares, (though he continued there onely
three,) and to be fed there through a trough, upon the bread
and water of affliction, being close manacled, and naked, within
a four square wall, built for that purpose, that he might there
perish in his own dung. This mans brother <em>Joseph Jeshurun</em> is now
living at this time in <em>Hamborough</em>. This miserable man calling upon
God, beseeching him to shew some signall testimony of his
innocencie, and citing before his divine tribunall the Senatours
who had with no more mercy, then justice, thus grievously and
inhumanely afflicted him; the blessed God was a just Judge,
for the Prince died suddenly at a banquet, the Sunday next ensuing
the giving of the sentence, and during the time of his imprisonment,
the aforesaid Senatours by little and little dropt away,
and died, which was prudently observed by those few that
yet remain’d, wherefore they resolved to deliver themselves by
restoring him to his liberty, accounting it as a particular divine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>providence: this man came out well, passed throughout all
<em>Italy</em>, where he was seen, to the admiration of all that had cognizance
of his sufferings, and died a few yeares since at <em>Jerusalem</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>14. The act of the faith (which is ordinarily done at <em>Toledo</em>)
was done at <em>Madrid, Anno 1632</em>, in the presence of the King of
<em>Spain</em>, where the Inquisitors did then take an oath of the King
and queen, that they should maintain and conserve the Catholick
faith in their dominions. In this act it is found printed, how
that a family of our nation was burnt, for confessing upon the
wrack the truth of a certain accusation of a maid servant, who,
(provoked out of some disgust) said, that they had scourged,
and whip’t an image, which by the frequent lashes, issued forth a
great deal of bloud, and crying with an out stretched voice, said
unto them, why do you thus cruelly scourge me? the whole nobility
well understood that it was all false, but things of the inquisition
all must hush.</p>

<p class='c007'>15. A very true story happened at <em>Lisbon, Anno 1631</em>. A certain
Church missed one night a silver pixe or box, wherein was the
popish hosts. And forasmuch as they had seen a young youth of
our nation, whose name was <em>Simao pires solis</em>, sufficiently noble,
to passe by the same night, not farre from thence, who went to visit
a Lady, he was apprehended, imprisoned, and terribly tortured.
They cut off his hands, and after they had dragged him along the
streets, burnt him. One year passed over, and a thief at the foot
of the gallowes confessed how he himself had rifled and plundered
the shrine of the host, and not that poor innocent whom they
had burnt. This young mans brother was a Frier, a great Theologist,
and a preacher, he lives now a <em>Jew</em> in <em>Amsterdam</em>, and calls
himself <em>Eliazar de solis</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>16. Some perhaps will say, that men are not blame worthy for
imputing to the <em>Jewes</em>, that which they themselves with their own
mouthes have confest. But surely he hath little understanding of
wracks, and tortures that speaks thus. An Earle of <em>Portugal</em>, when
his Physicyan was imprisoned for being a <em>Jew</em>, requested one of the
inquisitors, by letter, that he would cause him to be set at liberty,
for that he knew for certain that he was a very good Christian, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>he not being able to undergo the tortures inflicted on him, confessed
himself a <em>Iew</em>, and became a penitentiary. At which the
Earl being much incenst, feins himself sick, and desires the inquisitor
by one of his servants, that he would be pleased to come
and visit him. when he came, he commanded him that he should
confesse that himself was a <em>Iew</em>, and further, that he should put it
down in writing with his own hand, which when he refused to do,
he charges some of his servants to put a helmet that was red hot
in the fire, (provided for this purpose) upon his head; at which,
he not being able to endure this threatned torment, takes him
aside to confesse, and also he writ with his own hand that he was a
<em>Iew</em>: whereupon the Earl takes occasion to reprove his injustice,
cruelty, and inhumanity, saying, in like manner as you have confest,
did my Physicyan confesse. Besides that, you have presently,
onely out of fear, not sence of torment, confest more. For
this cause in the Israelitish Senate, no torture was ever inflicted,
but onely every person was convicted at the testimony of
two witnesses. That such like instruments of cruelty may enforce
children that have been tenderly educated, and fathers that have
lived deliciously to confesse that they have whipt an image, and
been guilty of such like criminall offences, daily experience may
demonstrate.</p>

<p class='c007'>17. Others will perchance alledge, these are histories indeed,
but they are not sacred, nor canonicall. I answer, Love and hatred
sayes <em>Plutarch</em>, corrupt the truth of every thing, as experience
sufficiently declares it; when we see that which comes to
passe, that one and the same thing, in one and the same city, at
one and the same time, is related in different manners. I my self
in my own Negotiation here have found it. For it hath been rumoured
abroad, that our nation had purchased S. <em>Pauls</em> Church
for to make it their Synagogue, notwithstanding that it was formerly
a temple consecrated to the worship of <em>Diana</em>. And many
other things have been reported of us that never entred into the
thoughts of our nation; as I have seen a fabulous Narrative of
the proceedings of a great Council of the <em>Iewes</em>, assembled in
the plain of <em>Ageda</em> in <em>Hungaria</em>, to determine whether the Messiah
were come or no.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>18. And now, since that it is evident that it is forbidden the
<em>Iewes</em> to eat any manner of bloud, and that to kill a man is directly
prohibited by our law, and the reasons before given are consentaneous
and agreeable to every ones understanding, I know it
will be inquired by many, but especially by those who are more
pious, and the friends of truth, how this calumnie did arise, and
from whence it derived its first originall. I may answer, that
this wickednesse is laid to their charge for divers reasons.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, <em>Ruffinus</em> the familiar friend of S. <em>Hierome</em> in his version of
<cite>Iosephus</cite> his second book that he writ against <em>Apion</em> the Grammarian
(for the Greek text is there wanting) tells us how <em>Apion</em> invented
this slander to gratifie <em>Antiochus</em>, to excuse his sacriledge,
and justifie his perfidious dealing with the <em>Iewes</em>, making their
estates supply his wants. <em>Propheta vero aliorum est Apion</em> &amp;c. <em>Apion</em>
is become a Prophet, and said that <em>Antiochus</em> found in the temple,
a bed, with a man lying upon it, and a table set before him, furnished
with all dainties both of sea and land, and fowles, and that
this man was astonished at them, and presently adores the entrance
of the King, as coming to succour and relieve him, and
prostrating himself at his knees, &amp; stretching out his right hand,
he implores liberty; whereat the King commanding him to sit down
and declare who he was, why he dwelt there, and what was the cause
of this his plentifull provision? the man with sighs and tears, lamentably
weeps out his necessity: and tells him that he
is a <em>Grecian</em>, and whilst he travelled about the province to get
food, he was suddenly apprehended, and caught up by some
strange men, and brought to the temple, and there shut up, that
he might be seen by no man, but be there fatted with all manner
of dainties, and that these unexpected benefits wrought in
him at the first joy, then suspicion, after that astonishment, and
last of all, advising with the Minister that came unto him, he understood
that the <em>Iewes</em> every year, at a certain time appointed
according to their secret and <em>ineffable</em> law, take up some Greek
stranger, and after he hath been fed delicately for the space of a
whole year, they bring him into a certain wood, and kill him.
Then according to their solem rites and ceremonies, they sacrifice
his body, and every one tasting of his intrails, in the offering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>up of this Greek, they enter into a solemn oath, that they
will bear an immortall feude and hatred to the Greeks. And then
they cast the reliques of this perishing man into a certain pit. After
this <em>Apion</em> makes him to say, that onely some few dayes remained
to him, before his execution, &amp; to desire the King that he, fearing
and worshipping the Grecian gods, would revenge the bloud
of his subjects upon the <em>Iewes</em>, and deliver him from his approaching
death. This fable (saith <em>Iosephus</em>) as it is most full of
all tragedy, so it abounds with cruell impudence, I had rather
you should read the confutation of this slander there, then I to
write it in this place, you will find it in the <em>Geneva</em> edition of <em>Iosephus</em>,
pag. 1066.</p>

<p class='c007'>Secondly, The very same accusation and horrid wickednesse
of killing children, and eating their bloud, was of old by the ancient
heathens, charg’d upon the Christians, that thereby they
might make them odious, and incense the common people against
them, as appeares by <em>Tertullian</em> in his <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Apologia contra gentes</span></i>,
<em>Iustin Martyr in apologia 2. ad Anton. Eusebius Cæsareensis</em> l. 5. cap. 1.
&amp; 4. <em>Pineda</em> in his <em>Monarchia Ecclesiastica</em> l. 11. c. 52. and many
others, as is known sufficiently. So that the imputation of this
cruelty, which as to them continues onely in memory, is to the
very same purpose, at this day charged upon the <em>Iewes</em>. And as
they deny this fact, as being falsly charged upon them, so in like
manner do we deny it, and I may say perhaps with a little more
reason, forasmuch as we eat not any manner of bloud, wherein
they do not think themselves obliged.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the reason of this slander was alwayes the <em>covetous ambition</em>
of some, who desiring to gain their wealth, and possesse themselves
of their estates, have forg’d and introduc’d this enormous
accusation, to colour their wickednesse, under a specious pretence
of revenging their own bloud. And to this purpose, I remember
that when I reproved a Rabbi (who came out of <em>Poland</em> to <em>Amsterdam</em>)
for the excesse of usurie in <em>Germany</em>, and <em>Poland</em>, which
they exacted of the Christians, and told him how moderate they
in <em>Holland</em> and in <em>Italy</em> were, he replyed, we are of necessity constrained
to do so, because they so often raise up false witnesses
against us, and levie more from us at once, then we are able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>get again by them in many yeares. And so, as experience
shews, it usually succeeds with our poor people under this
pretext and colour.</p>

<p class='c007'>19. And so it hath been divers times; men mischieving the
<em>Iewes</em> to excuse their own wickednesse; as to instance one precedent
in the time of a certain King of <em>Portugal</em>. The Lord,
blessed for ever, took away his sleep one night, (as he did from
King <em>Ahashuerus</em>) and he went up into a belcony in the palace,
from whence he could discover the whole city, and from thence
(the moon shining clear) he espyed two men carrying a dead
corps, which they cast into a <em>Iew’s</em> yard. He presently dispatches a
couple of servants, and commands them, yet with a seeming carelesnesse,
they should trace and follow those men, and take notice
of their house; which they accordingly did. The next day there
is a hurly burly and a tumult in the city, accusing the <em>Iewes</em> of
murder. Thereupon the King apprehends these rogues, and they
confesse the truth; and considering that this businesse was guided
by a particular divine providence, calls some of the wise men of
the <em>Iewes</em>, and asks them how they translate the 4. verse of the
121 Psalm, and they answered, <em>Behold, he that keepeth Israel will
neither slumber nor sleep</em>. The King replied, if he will not slumber
then much lesse will he sleep, you do not say well, for the true
translation is, <em>Behold, the Lord doth not slumber, neither will he suffer
him that keepeth Israel to sleep</em>. God who hath yet a care over you,
hath taken away my sleep, that I might be an eye witnesse of that
wickednesse which is this day laid to your charge. This with
many such like relations we may read in the book called <cite>Scebet
Iehuda</cite>, how sundry times, when our nation was at the very brink
of destruction, for such forged slanders, the truth hath discovered
it self for their deliverance.</p>

<p class='c007'>20. This matter of bloud hath been heretofore discussed and
disputed before one of the Popes, at a full councell; where it
was determined to be nothing else but a mere calumnie: and
hereupon gave liberty to the <em>Iewes</em> to dwell in his countryes,
and gave the princes of <em>Italy</em> to understand the same, as also
<em>Alfonso</em> the wise King of <em>Spain</em>. And suppose any one man had
done such a thing, as I believe never any <em>Iew</em> did so, yet this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>were great cruelty to punish a whole nation for one mans
wickednesse.</p>

<p class='c007'>21. But why should I use more words about this matter, seeing
all that is come upon us, was foretold by all the prophets?
<em>Moses</em>, <em>Deut.</em> 28.61. <em>Moreover, every sicknesse and every plague which
is not written in the book of this law, them will the Lord bring upon
thee, &amp;c. because thou hast not hearkned to the voice of the Lord thy
God.</em> <em>David</em> in the 44. Psalm make a dolefull complaint of those
evils, and ignominious reproaches, wherewith we are invironed
round about in this captivity, as if we were the proper center of
misery, saying, <em>For thy sake are we killed all the day long, we are
counted as sheep for the slaughter</em>. The same he speaks Psalm 74. and
in other Psalms.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Ezekiel</em> more particularly mentions this calumnie; God, blessed
for ever, promising Chap. 36.13. that in time to come the devouring
of men, or the eating of mans bloud shall be no more
imputed to them, according to the true and proper exposition of
the learned <em>Don Isaac Abarbanel</em>. The blessed God, according to
the multitude of his mercies, will have compassion upon his people,
and will take away the reproach of Israel from off the earth,
that it may be no more heard, as is prophesied by <em>Isaiah</em>, and let
this suffice to have spoken as to this point.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE SECOND SECTION.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Your worship desired joyntly, to know what ceremony, or
humiliation the <em>Iewes</em> use in their Synagogues, toward
the book of the Law; for which they are by some ignorantly
reputed to be idolaters. I shall answer it in Order.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, the <em>Iewes</em> hold themselves bound to stand up when the
book of the Law written upon parchment, is taken out of the
desk, untill it is opened on the pulpit, to shew it to the people,
and afterwards to be read. We see that observed in <em>Nehemias</em>,
chap.<a id='t122'></a> 8.6. where it is said, <em>And when he had opened it, all the people
stood up</em>. and this they do in reverence to the word of God, and
that sacred Book.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>For the same cause, when it passeth from the desk toward the
pulpit, all that it passeth by, bow down their heads a little, with
reverence; which can be no idolatry for these following
reasons.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, it is one thing <em>adorare</em>, <em>viz.</em> to <em>adore</em>, and another <em>venerari</em>,
<em>viz.</em> to <em>worship</em>. For <em>Adoration</em> is forbidden to any creature, whether
Angelicall, or Earthly; but <em>Worship</em> may be given to either
of them, as to men of a higher rank, commonly stiled <em>worshipfull</em>.
And so <em>Abraham</em>, who in his time rooted out vain idolatry,
humbled himself, and also prostrated himself before those three
guests, which then he entertained for <em>Men</em>. As also <em>Iosuah</em> the holy
Captain of the people, did prostrate himself to another Angel,
which with a sword in his hand, made him afraid, at the gates of
<em>Iericho</em>. Wherefore if those were just men, and if we are obliged
to follow their example, and they were not reprehended for it,
it is clear, that to worship the Law in this manner as we do, can be
no idolatry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Secondly, The <em>Iewes</em> are very scrupulous in such things, and
fear in the least, to <em>appear</em> to give any honour or reverence to
images. And so it is to be seen in the <em>Talmud</em>, and in R. <em>Moses</em> of
<em>Egypt</em> in his Treatise of idolatry: That if by chance any Israelite
should passe by a Church, that had images on the outside, and at
that time a thorn should run into his foot, he may not stoop to
pull it out, because he that should see him, might suspect he bowed
to such an image. Therefore according to this strictnesse, if
that were any appearance of idolatry to bow to the Law, the <em>Iewes</em>
would utterly abhorre it; and since they do it, it is an evident
sign that it is none.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thirdly, to <em>kisse images</em> is the principall worship of idolatry,
as God saith, in the 1 of <em>Kings</em> 19.19. <em>Yet I have left me seven thousand
in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed unto Baal, and every
mouth that hath not kissed him.</em> But if that were so, it would follow,
that all men, who kisse the Testament after they are sworn, should
be idolaters. But because that is not so, since that act is but a simple
worship, by the same reason it will follow, that to bow the
head, cannot be reputed for idolatry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourthly, Experience sheweth, that in all Nations the ceremonies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>that men use mutually one towards another, is to bow
the head; And also there are degrees thereof, according to the
quality of the person with whom they speak; which shew that in
the opinion of all nations, it is no idolatry, and therefore much
lesse, to reverence the Law with bowing of the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fifthly, In <em>Asia</em> (and it is the same almost in all the world) the
people receiving a decree, or order of the king, they take it, and
kisse it, and set it upon the head. We owe much more to Gods
word, and to his divine Commandments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sixthly, <em>Ptolomeus Philadelphus</em>, receiving the 72 <em>Interpreters</em>
with the book of the Law, into his presence, he rose from his seat,
and prostrating himself seven times, worshipped it, (as <em>Aristæus</em>
assures us.) If a Gentile did this to a law which he thought did
not oblige him, much more do we owe reverence to that Law
which was particularly given unto us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seventhly, The <em>Israelites</em> hold for the Articles of their Faith, that
there is a God; who is one in most simple unity; eternall, incorporeall;
who gave the written Law unto his people Israel, by the hand
of <em>Moses</em>, the Prince, and chief of all the Prophets; whose Providence
takes care for the world which he created; who takes notice
of all mens works, and rewardeth or punisheth them. Lastly,
that one day <em>Messias</em> shall come to gather together the scattered
Israelites, and shortly after shall be the resurrection of the
dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are their Doctrines, which I believe contain not any idolatry;
nor yet in the opinion of those that are of other judgements;
For, as a most learned Christian of our time hath written, in a
French book, which he calleth the <cite>Rappel</cite> of the <em>Iewes</em> (in which
he makes the King of <em>France</em> to be their leader, when they shall
return to their country,) the <em>Iewes</em>, saith he, shall be saved, for
yet we expect a <em>second</em> coming of the same <em>Messias</em>; and the <em>Iewes</em>
believe that that coming is the <em>first</em>, and not the second, and by
that faith they shall be saved; for the difference consists onely
in the circumstance of the time.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>
  <h4 class='c013'>THE THIRD SECTION.</h4>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Sir, I hope I have given satisfaction to your worship, touching
those points. I shall yet further inform you with the same
sincerity, concerning the rest. <em>Sixtus Senensis</em> in his <em>Bibliothæca</em>,
lib. 2. <em>Titulo contra Talmud</em>, and others, as <em>Biatensis</em>, <em>Ordine</em>
1. <em>Tract.</em> 1. <em>Titulo</em> Perachot. averre out of the <em>Talmud</em>. cap. 4.
“that every <em>Iew</em>, thrice a day, curseth all Christians, and prayeth
to God to confound, and root them out, with their Kings and
Princes. And this is especially done in the <em>Synagogue</em>, by the
<em>Iewes</em> Priests, thrice a day.” I pray let such as love the truth,
see the <em>Talmud</em>, in the quoted place; and they shall find nothing
of that which is objected: onely there is recited in the said fourth
Chapter, the daily prayer, which speaks of <em>Minim</em>, that is, <em>Hereticks,
ordained</em> in <em>Tabne</em>, (that is a town not farre from <em>Ierusalem</em>,
between <em>Gath</em> and <em>Gazim</em>, &amp;c.) the Talmud hath no more.
Hence <em>Sixtus Senensis</em> by distillation, draws forth the foresaid calumnie,
whenas, what the <em>Talmud</em> rehearseth briefly, to be made
onely by the wise men in the said Town, he saith, was a constitution
in the <em>Talmud</em> long after.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now let us see what was done by those wise men in the said
Town; and let us examine, whether that may justly offend the
Christians.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is in the daily prayers a certain Chapter where it is thus
written, <em>la-Mumarim</em>, &amp;c. that is, <em>For Apostates, let there
be no hope, let all Hereticks be destroyed, and all thine enemies,
and all that hate thee, let them perish. And thou shalt root out the
kingdome of pride forthwith, weaken, and put it out, and in our dayes.</em>
This whole Chapter speaketh nothing of Christians originally,
but of the <em>Iewes</em>, who fell in those times, to the <em>Zaduces</em>, and <em>Epicureans</em>,
and to the Gentiles, as <em>Moses</em> of <em>Egypt</em> saith, Tract. <em>Tephila.</em>
cap. 2. For by Apostates and Hereticks are not to be understood
all men, that are of a diverse religion, or heathens, or
Gentiles, but those renegado <em>Iewes</em>, who did abrogate the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Law of <em>Moses</em>, or any Articles received thence; and such are properly
by us called <em>Hereticks</em>. For according to the Law of Christians,
he is not properly an Apostate, or Hereteck, who is originally
bred a scholler and a candid follower from his youth of a
diverse law, and so continueth: otherwise native <em>Iewes</em> and <em>Hagarens</em>,
and other Nations that are no Christians, nor ever were,
should be properly called Apostates, and Hereticks in respect
of Christians, which is absurd, as it is absurd for the <em>Iewes</em> to
call the Christians Apostates, or Hereticks. Wherefore it speaketh
nothing of Christians, but of the fugitive <em>Iewes</em>, that is, such
as have deserted the standard, or the sacred Law.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Lastly, neither the kingdomes, nor kings that are Christians,
or <em>Hagarens</em>, or followers of other Sects are cursed here, but
namely the kingdome of Pride. Certain it is that in that time
(wherein, our wise men added to the daily Prayers the foresaid
Chapter) there was no kingdome of Christians, what therefore
that kingdome of pride was, should any man ask, who can plainly
shew it? So much as we can conjecture by it, it is the kingdome
of the <em>Romans</em> which then flourished, which did rule over
all Nations tyrannically and proudly, especially over the <em>Iewes</em>.
For, after that, <em>Vespasian</em>, with his son <em>Titus</em>, had dissipated all <em>Iudea</em>.
And though som <em>Roman</em> Emperours after that became Christians,
or had a good opinion of Christianity, yet the kingdome
of the <em>Romans</em> was heathenish, and without distinction, was proud,
and tyrannicall. And however the <em>Iewes</em> repeated the same words
of the prayer when the Prince was very good, and they lived under
a just government, that they did, onely of an ancient custome,
without any malice to the present government. And now
truly in all their books printed again, the foresaid words are wanting,
lest they should now be unjustly objected against the <em>Iewes</em>;
and so for <em>Apostates</em> and <em>Hereticks</em>, they say, <em>secret accusers, or betrayers</em>
of the <em>Iewes</em>. And for the <em>kingdome of pride</em>, they substitute
<em>all Zedim</em>, that is, <em>proud men</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. After this manner, to avoid scandall, did the 72 Interpreters,
who coming in <em>Leviticus</em>, to unclean beasts; in the place
of <em>Arnebeth</em> which signifies the <em>Hare</em>, they put <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δασύποδα</span>, that is,
<em>rough foot</em>: leaving the Name, and keeping the sense. They would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>not retein the Hebrew word <em>Arnebeth</em>, as they have done in some
other appellatives, lest the wife of <em>Ptolomy</em> whose name was <em>Arnebet</em>,
should think that the <em>Iewes</em> had mocked her, if they should
have placed her name amongst the unclean beasts. Neither would
they render it <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λαγωὸν</span> <em>lagoon</em>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λαγὸν</span> <em>lagon</em>, which in the Greek language
signifies a <em>Hare</em>, lest <em>Ptolomy</em> himself who was the son, and
nephew of the <em>Lagi</em>, should be offended, to see the name of his
family registred among the creatures that were unclean. Besides,
<em>Plutarch</em> records, how that it was deeply resented, as a very
high affront, and contempt, when one asked <em>Ptolomy</em>, who was
<em>Lagus</em> his father, as is it scoffingly reflected upon his obscure extraction
and descent.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The very like calumnie fell out concerning the very same
Chapter of our Prayer, when <em>Mulet Zidan</em> reigned in <em>Morocco</em>.
A certain fugitive<a id='t127'></a> <em>Iew</em>, to shew himself constant in the Mahumetan
Religion, and an enemy to his own Nation, accused the <em>Iewes</em>
before this king, saying, that they prayed to God for his destruction,
when they mention in their prayers all <em>Zedim</em>, as though
they would have all the Family of <em>Zidan</em> destroyed. They excused
themselves with the truth, and affirmed, in praying against
<em>Zedim</em>, that they prayed onely against <em>proud men</em>, (as that word in
their Hebrew language properly signifieth) and not against his
Majesty. The King admitted of their excuse; but said unto
them, that because of the equivocation of the word, they should
change it for another.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. For certain, the <em>Iewes</em> give no occasion, that any Prince,
or Magistrate should be offended with them; but contrariwise,
as it seems to me, they are bound to love them, to defend, and
protect them. For, by their <em>Law</em>, and <em>Talmud</em>, and the inviolable
<em>custome</em> of the dispersed <em>Iewes</em>, every where, upon every Sabbath
day, and in all yearly solemnities, they have prayers for Kings
and Princes, under whose Government the <em>Iewes</em> live, be they
Christians, or of other Religions, I say by their <em>Law</em>, as <em>Ieremiah</em>
ch. 29. commandeth, <em>viz.</em> <em>Seek ye the peace of the city, whither
I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray for them,
unto the Lord</em>, &amp;c. By the <em>Talmud</em> ord. 4. Tract. 4. <em>Abodazara.</em>
cap. 1. <em>there is a prayer for the peace of the Kingdome</em>, from <em>custome</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>never intermitted of the <em>Iewes</em>. Wheresoever they are on the
Sabbath day, and their annuall solemnities, the Minister of the
Synagogue before he blesseth the people of the <em>Iewes</em>, doth with
a loud voice, blesse the Prince of the country under whom they
live, that all the <em>Iewes</em> may hear it; and they say Amen. You
have seen the Form of the prayer in the book entitled The humble
Addresses.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. In like manner the ancients observe, that whereas God commands
in <em>Numbers</em> 29.13. that seventy bullocks should be sacrificed
upon the seven dayes of the feast of tabernacles, that this
was in respect of the seventy nations (who shall one day come up
to <em>Ierusalem</em>, year after year, to keep this feast of tabernacles,
<em>Zechar.</em> 14.16.) for whose conservation they also sacrificed. For
they say, that <em>all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in Abraham,
and in his seed, not onely spiritually, and in the knowledge of the one first
cause, but also that at this time they shall enjoy temporall, and earthly
blessings, by vertue of that promise</em>. And so in the time of the second
temple, they offered up sacrifice for their confederate nations, as
may appear by these ensuing instances.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <em>Megilat Tahanit.</em> cap. 9. it is reported, that when <em>Alexander</em>
the great, at the instigation of the <em>Samaritans</em>, that inhabited
mount <em>Gerizim</em>, went with a resolution to destroy the temple,
<em>Simeon</em> the just met him in the way, and amongst divers reasons
that he urged to divert him from his purpose, told him, <em>this is the
place, where we pray unto God for the welfare of your self, and of your
kingdome, that it may not be destroyed, and shall these men perswade
you to destroy this place</em>?</p>

<p class='c007'>The like we find in the first book of the <em>Maccabees</em>, cap. 7.33.
and in <em>Iosephus</em> his Antiq. <em>lib.</em> 12. <em>cap.</em> 17. when <em>Demetrius</em> had sent
<em>Nicanor</em> the Generall of his army against <em>Jerusalem</em>, the Priests, with
the Elders of the people went forth to salute him, and to shew
him the sacrifice which they offered up to God for the welfare of
the King.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the same history <em>lib.</em> 2.3. and in <em>Josephus Gorionides</em> lib. 3.
cap. 16. we may read, that <em>Heliodorus</em> Generall to <em>Selencus</em>, came to
<em>Jerusalem</em> with the same intent, <em>Onias</em> the High-priest, besought
him, not to destroy that place, where they prayed to God for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the prosperity of the King, and his issue, and for the conservation
of his kingdome.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first Chapter of <em>Baruch</em>, the disciple of <em>Jeremiah</em>, we
find that the <em>Iewes</em>, who were first carried captive into <em>Babylon</em>
with <em>Iechonias</em>, made a collection of money, according to every
ones power, and sent it to <em>Jerusalem</em>, saying, <em>Behold, we have sent
you money, wherewith ye shall buy offerings, and pray for the life of
Nebuchadnezzar, and for the life of Baltasar his sonne, that their dayes
may be upon earth as the dayes of heaven, and that God would give us
strength, and lighten our eyes, that we may live under their shadow,
that we may long do them service, and find favour in their sight</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>Iewes</em> in <em>Asia</em> did the same, as is reported by <em>Josephus Gorionides</em>,
lib. 3. cap. 4. they sent letters, with a present to <em>Hircanus</em>
the High-priest, desiring that prayers might be made for the life
of <em>Augustus Cæsar</em>, and his companion <em>Marcus Antonius</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Philo Judæus</em>, in the book of his Embassage to <em>Caius</em>, making
mention of a letter which <em>Caius</em> sent, requiring his statue to be set
up in the sacred temple, and <em>Agrippa’s</em> answer thereupon, unto
the said Emperour, reports, that there were these words in it, <em>viz.</em>
<em>The Iewes sacrifice for the prosperity of your Empire, and that not
onely upon their solemn feasts, but also every day</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The like is recorded by <em>Josephus</em>, (lib. 2. cap. 9. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De bello Judaico</span></i>)
the <em>Iewes</em> said to <em>Petronius</em> Generall to the Emperour <em>Caius</em>, we
<em>daily offer up burnt offerings unto God, for the peace of the Emperour,
and the whole people of Rome</em>. And in his second book against <em>Apion</em>,
he sayes, <em>we Hebrews have allwayes accustomed to honour Emperours
with particular sacrifices</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither was this service ever entertained unthankfully, as appears
by the decree of <em>Cyrus</em>, <em>Ezra</em> 6.3. where also <em>Darius</em> commands,
that <em>of the Kings goods, even of the tribute, expences should be
forth-with given unto the Elders of the Iewes</em> &amp;c. <em>and that which they
had need of, both young bullocks, and rammes, and lambs for the burnt-offerings
of the Lord of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine, and oyl</em>, &amp;c. <em>that
they might offer sacrifices of a sweet savour, unto the God of heaven,
and pray for the life of the King, and of his sonnes</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same also was commanded afterwards by <em>Artaxerxes</em>, who
also conferred liberally many large gifts, as well towards the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>building of the temple, as the maintaining of the sacrifices. As
for <em>Alexander</em> the great, he lighted down out of his chariot, and
bowed himself at the feet of the High-priest, desiring him to offer
up sacrifice to God on his behalf. And who can be ignorant of
<em>Ptolomy Philadelphus</em>, how richly he endowed the temple, as is recorded
by <em>Aristeas</em>? Nor did <em>Antiochus</em> king of the <em>Greeks</em> unlike
this, when by a publick edict, he forbid <em>that any stranger should
enter the temple, to prophane that place, which the Hebrews had consecrated
to religion, and divine worship</em>. (Josephus <em>lib.</em> 12. <em>cap.</em> 3.)
<em>Demetrius</em> did the like, (<em>Josephus</em> lib. 13. cap. 5.6.) To which may
be added, that when they of <em>Ierusalem</em> contended with them of
<em>Samaria</em>, about the honour and dignity of the temple, before
<em>Alexander</em> the great, the <em>Ierusalem</em> Priest in his plea, urged, <em>that
this temple was ever had in great reverence by all the Kings of</em> Asia, <em>and
by them enricht with sundry splendid and magnificent gifts</em>. In the Second
book of <em>Iosephus</em> against <em>Apion</em>, we read, that <em>Ptolomy Euergetes</em>,
when he had conquered <em>Syria</em>, offered up <em>Eucharisticall sacrifices</em>,
not to idols, and false Gods, but to the true God, at <em>Ierusalem</em>,
according to the manner of the <em>Iewes</em>. <em>Pompey</em> the great, as
is mentioned by <em>Iosephus de bello Iudaico</em> (lib. 1. cap. 5.) durst not
spoyl, no nor so much as touch the treasures of the temple, not
because (as <em>Tully</em> in his Oration for <em>Plancius</em> supposeth, to whom
<em>Augustine</em> in his book <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de civitate Dei assentos</span></cite>) he feared lest he
might be thought too avaritious; for this seems in comparison,
very ridiculous, and childish; for military law would soon have
acquitted him for this; but because of the reverence to the place
with which his mind was so affected. <em>Philo Iudæus</em>, (p. 102. 6.)
relates a letter of <em>Agrippa’s</em>, where he writes, that <em>Augustus Cæsar</em> had
the temple in so great reverence, that he commanded a sacrifice
of one bullock, and two lambs, to be offered up every day out
of his own revenues. And his wife <em>Iulia Augusta</em>, adorn’d it with
golden cups, and basons, and many other costly gifts. Neither
did <em>Cleopatra</em> Queen of <em>Egypt</em>, fall short of her liberallity. <em>Tiberius</em>
throughout the 22 years of his Empire, commanded sacrifices
to be offered up unto God, out of his own tribute. The
like did <em>Nero</em>, till the unadvised rashnesse of <em>Eleazar</em> in refusing
his sacrifice, alienated the mind of the Emperour, that he became
the cause of a bloudy persecution.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>And by all this, we may the better interpret that 11 verse of the
1. chap. of <em>Malachy</em> (who flourisht in the second temple,) The
words are, <em>From the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the
same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incense
shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering; for my name
shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts</em>. For besides
that the heathens termed the temple <em>the house of the great God</em>,
(<em>Ezra</em> 5.8.) they and their Monarchs, and Emperours, both of
<em>Persia</em>, <em>Grece</em>, and <em>Rome</em>, desired, as we have heard, to have sacrifices,
and incense, offered for them in Gods name.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. And let the reader be pleased further to observe, that the
<em>Iewes</em> were accustomed, not onely to offer up sacrifices, and prayers
to God, for the Emperours, their friends, confederates, and
allyes, but also generally for the whole world. It is the custome
(saith <em>Agrippa</em> to <em>Caius</em> according to <em>Philo</em> p. 1035.) for the High-priest,
at the day of attonement, to make a prayer unto God, for
all mankind; beseeching him to adde unto them another year,
with blessing and peace. The same <em>Philo Iudæus</em> in his second book
of <cite>Monarchy</cite> saith, <em>The priests of other nations pray unto God onely for
the welfare of their own particular nations, but our High-priest prayes
for the happinesse and prosperity of the whole world</em>. And in his book
of sacrifices, p. 836. he saith, <em>Some sacrifices are offered up for our
nation, and some for all mankind. For the daily sacrifices, twice a day,
viz. at morning, and evening, are for the obtaining of those good things,
which God the chief good, grants unto them, at those two times of the
day.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>And in like manner, <em>Iosephus</em> in his second book against <em>Apion</em>
saith, <em>We sacrifice, and pray unto the Lord, in the first place, for the
whole world, for their prosperity, and peace, and afterwards more particularly
for our selves, forasmuch (as we conceive) that prayer which
is first extended universally, and is afterwards put up more particularly,
is very much acceptable unto God</em>. Which words are also related by
<em>Eusebius Cæsareensis</em>, in his <em>Præparatio Evangelica</em>, lib. 8. cap. 2.</p>

<p class='c007'>10. ’Tis true, that no outward materiall glories are perpetuall;
and so the <em>temple</em> had its period, and with the <em>paschall lamb</em>, all
other sacrifices ceased: But in their stead, we have at this day
<em>prayer</em>, and as <em>Hoseah</em> speaks Cap. 14.2. For bullocks, we render
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span><em>the calves of our lips</em>. And three times every day, this is our humble
supplication, and request to God, <em>Fill the whole world, O Lord,
with thy blessings; for all creatures are the works of thy hands; as it is
written, the Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his
works</em> Psal. 145.9.</p>

<p class='c007'>11. Yea further, we pray for the conversion of the nations,
and so we say in these most excellent prayers, upon <em>Ros a sana</em>
and the day of attonement, <em>Our God, and the God of our Fathers,
reign thou over the whole world in thy glory; and be thou exalted over
all the earth, in thine excellency; cause thy influence to descend upon all
the inhabitants of the world, in the glorious majesty of thy strength;
and let every creature know that thou hast created him; and let every
thing that is formed, understand that thou hast formed it; and let all
that have breath in their nostrills say, the Lord God of Israel reigneth,
and his kingdome is over all dominions</em>. And again, <em>Let all the inhabitants
of the earth know, and see, that unto thee every knee shall bow, and
every tongue swear; before thee, O Lord our God, let them bow, and
prostrate themselves; let them give honour to the honour of thy name,
and let them all take upon them the yoak of thy kingdome</em>, &amp;c. And
again, <em>Put thy fear, O Lord, our God, upon all thy works, and thy
dread upon all that thou hast created; let all thy works fear thee, and
let all creatures bow down before thee and let them all make themselves
one handfull</em>, (that is, with joynt consent) <em>to do thy will with a perfect
heart</em>, &amp;c. A most worthy imitation of the wise King <em>Solomon</em>,
who after he had finished the building of the Temple, in
that long prayer <em>King.</em> 1.8. was not unmindfull of the Gentiles,
but v. 41. he saith, <em>Moreover, concerning a stranger, that is not of thy
people of Israel, but cometh out of a farre country, for thy names sake,
for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy
stretched-out arm, when he shall come, and pray towards this house,
hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the
stranger calleth to thee for, that all people of the earth may know thy
name, to fear thee, as do the people of Israel, and that they may know
that thy name is called upon this house which I have builded</em>. Where
it may be observed, that when the Israelite comes to pray, he
saith, 29. <em>and give every man according to his wayes</em>; but upon the
prayer of a stranger, he saith, <em>and do according to all that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>stranger calleth to thee for</em>. And this distinction is made to this
end, that by the evident, and apparent return, and answer of their
prayers, all Gentiles might effectually be brought in to the
truth, and knowledge, and fear of God, as well as the Israelites.</p>

<p class='c007'>12. Moreover, since the holy prophets made prayers, and supplications
for all men, as well for the <em>nations</em>, as the <em>Israelites</em>,
how should not we do the same, for the nations, among whom we
inhabit, as ingaged by a more especiall obligation, for that we
live under their favour and protection? In <em>Deuteronomy</em> 23.7.
God commands <em>Thou shalt not abhorre an Egyptian</em>, notwithstanding
the heavy burthens they afflicted us with, onely <em>because thou
wast a stranger in his land</em>, because that at the first, they entertained,
and received us into their country.</p>

<p class='c007'>As on the other side, <em>Ezek.</em> 23.11. he saith, <em>As I live, saith the
Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the
wicked turn from his way and live</em>. We ought therefore to imitate
his actions, and not to hate any man, upon the mere account
of religion, but onely to pray to the Lord for his conversion;
and this also, without giving offence, or any kind of molestation.
To detest, or abhorre those, to whom we owe that prosperity
which we enjoy, or who endeavour their own salvation, is a thing
very unworthy, and ill becoming; but to abhorre their vices,
and sins, is not so. It was a very excellent observation, of a most
wise, and vertuous Lady, <em>Beruria</em>, who (as it is recorded in the
<em>Talmud</em>, <em>Berachot</em> cap. 1.) when her husband <em>R. Meir</em> was about to
pray to God, to destroy some of his perverse, and froward neighbours,
that had no lesse grievously, then maliciously vexed, and
molested him, gave him this seasonable admonition, that such a
thing <em>ought not to be done in Israel; but that he should rather make his
prayer, that they might return, and break off their sinnes by repentance,
alledging that text</em>, Psal. 104.35. <em>Let sin be consumed out of the earth</em>;
it is not said <em>sinners</em>, but <em>sinnes</em>; and then <em>the wicked shall be no
more</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>13. We have now in this Section shewn, that it is a mere calumnie
to imagine, that we <em>Iewes</em> should pray to God, so as to give an
offence to the Christians, or cause scandall, by any thing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>our prayers, unlesse it be that we are not Christians, we have declared
to the contrary, how we daily pray for them. As also that
during the temple, we offered up sacrifices, for nations confederate
with us, and how all Emperours desired this. Yea, and we
offered sacrifices, not onely for particular princes, but for all
mankind in generall. How, since sacrifices ceased, with the temple,
we at this day, do the same in our prayers, and how we beseech
God for their salvation, without giving any scandall, or
offence in respect of religion; and how we think our selves obliged
to perform all this, by the sacred Scripture. By all which
layed together, I hope I have sufficiently evidenced the truth,
of that I have asserted.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE FOURTH SECTION.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>By consequence, the accusation of <em>Buxtorphius</em>, in his <em>Bibliotheca
Rabbinorum</em>, can have no appearance of truth, concerning
that which he puts upon us, <em>viz.</em> that we are <em>blasphemers</em>.
I will set down the Prayer it self.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are bound to praise the Lord of all things; to magnifie
him, who made the world, for that he hath not made us, as the
Nations of the earth; nor hath he placed us as the families of
the earth; nor hath he made our condition like unto theirs, nor
our lot, according to all their multitude. For they humble
themselves to things of no worth, and vanity, and make their
prayers to gods that cannot save them; but we worship before
the King of kings, that is holy, and blessed; that stretched
forth the Heavens, and framed the Earth; the seat of his glory
is in heaven above, and his divine strength in the highest of
the Heavens; He is our God, and there is no other; He is truly,
our King, and besides him, there is no other; as it is written
in the Law. And know this day, and return into thine own
heart, because the Lord is God, in Heaven above, and upon the
Earth beneath, there is no other.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Truly, in my opinion, it is a very short, and most excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>prayer, and worthy of commendation. The <em>Sultan Selim</em>,
that famous conquerour, and Emperour of the <em>Mahumetans</em>,
made so much account of it, that he commanded his Doctor <em>Moses
Amon</em>, (who translated the <em>Pentateuch</em> into the <em>Arabian</em> and <em>Persian</em>
languages) that he should translate our prayers. And when
he had delivered them to him in the <em>Turkish</em> Tongue, he said to
him, what need is there of so long prayers? truly this one might
suffice, he did so highly esteem and value it. This is like an other
prayer which was made at that time, <em>viz.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>“Blessed be our God, who created us for his honour, and separated
us from those that are in errours, and gave unto us a
Law of truth, and planted amongst us eternall life. Let him
open our hearts in his law, and put his love in our hearts, and
his fear, to do his will, and to serve him with a perfect heart,
that we may not labour in vain, nor beget children of perdition.
Let it be thy will, O Lord our God, and God of our Fathers,
that we may keep thy statutes, and thy laws in this world,
and may deserve, and live, and inherit well, and that we may attain
the blessing of the world to come, that so we may sing
to thy honour, without ceasing. O Lord my God, I will praise
thee for ever.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But neither the one, nor the other is a <em>blasphemy</em>, or malediction
against any other Gods, for these reasons following.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. It is not the manner of the <em>Iewes</em> by their law to curse other
gods by name, though they be of the <em>Gentiles</em>. So in <em>Exod.</em>
cap. 22.27. <em>Thou shalt not revile the Gods.</em> Heb. <span lang='iw' xml:lang='ar' dir='rtl'>אלהום</span>, that is
<em>Gods</em>, or God, as <em>Philo Iudæus in libro de Monarchiâ</em>, doth interpret,
and not Judges, as <em>Onkelus</em> and <em>Ionathan</em> translate in their <em>Chald.</em>
Paraphr. Where <em>Philo</em> addes this reason, which is, lest they hearing
their own Gods blasphemed, should in a revengefull way of retaliation,
blaspheme the true God of Israel. And we have examples
enough, how the idolatrous heathen used to revile, and defame
each others Gods, both in <em>Cicero</em>, and <em>Iuvenal</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>And in that sense <em>Flavius Josephus</em> in his book written against
<em>Apion</em>, saith these words: “As it is our practise to observe our
own, and not to accuse, or revile others; so neither may we deride,
or blaspheme<a id='t135'></a> those, which others account to be Gods.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Our Law-giver plainly forbad us that, by reason of that compellation,
Gods.” According to this, by our own religion,
we dare not do that which <em>Buxtorsius</em> chargeth us with. And upon
this account the Talmudists tell us, that we ought to honour, and
reverence, not onely the Kings of Israel, but all kings, princes,
and governours, in generall, forasmuch as the holy Scripture gives
them the stile of gods, in respect of the dignity of their
office.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The time wherein these, as also the other prayers were composed,
and ordered, was in the dayes of <em>Ezras</em>, who, with 120
men, amongst whom were three Prophets, <em>Haggai</em>, <em>Zechary</em>, <em>Malachy</em>,
composed them, as we have it in the <em>Talmud</em>. Wherefore he
cannot say, that there is any thing intended against honour, or
reverence of Christ, who was not born till many yeares after.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, the <em>Iewes</em>, since that calumny was first raised, (though<a id='t136'></a>
that was spoken of the Gentiles, and their vain gods, <em>humbling
themselves to things of no worth, and vanity</em>) because they desire to
decline, and avoid the least occasion of scandall, and offence, have
left off to print that line, and do not in some books print any
part thereof. As <em>John Hoornbeek</em> also witnesses, in his fore-mentioned
<em>Prolegomena</em>, and <em>William Dorstius</em>, in his observations upon
<em>R. David Gawz</em>, p. 269. and <em>Buxtorf</em> in his book of <cite>Abbreviatures</cite>.
And perhaps it will be worthy our observation, that all these three
witnesses say, that it was first made known to them, by one <em>Antonius
Margarita</em>, who was a <em>Iew</em>, converted to the Christian faith.
That this part of the prayer was intended <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contra idola Papatus</span></i>,
against the <em>Popish idols</em>, which they therefore, as by a necessary
consequence, interpret, as against <em>Christ</em>; but how justly, let the
unprejudiced and unbiased reader judge.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. If this be so, how can it be thought, that in their <em>Synagogues</em>,
they name him with scornfull spitting, (farre be it from us.)
The Nation of the <em>Iewes</em> is <em>wise, and ingenius</em>. So said the Lord,
<em>Deut.</em> cap. 4.6. <em>The Nations shall say, surely this is a wise, and an understanding
people.</em> Therefore, how can it be supposed, that they
should be so bruitish in a strange land, when their Religion dependeth
not upon it? Certainly, it is much contrary to the precept
we spake of, to shew any resemblance of scorn. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>never any such thing done, (as it is well known) in <em>Italy</em>, and
<em>Holland</em>, where ordinarily the <em>Synagogues</em> are full of <em>Christians</em>;
which with great attention, stand considering, and weighing all
their actions, and motions. And truly they should have found
great occasion to find fault withall, if that were so. But never was
any man heard thus to calumniate us, where ever we dwell and inhabite,
which is a reason sufficiently valid, to clear us. Wherefore,
I suppose, that I have sufficiently informed you, concerning
our prayers, in which we purpose nothing, but to praise God, and
to ask spirituall, and temporall blessings, and by our service,
and worship, implore the divine benevolence, protection, and
defence.</p>

<h4 class='c013'>THE FIFTH SECTION.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>But forasmuch as it is reported, that we draw, and seduce others
to our religion, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>1. Never unto this day, in any part hath this been suspected,
where the <em>Iewes</em> are dispersed; nor can it find place here.
Truly, I have held friendship with many great men, and the wisest,
and most eminent of all <em>Europe</em>; and also they came to see
me, from many places, at my house, and I had many friendly discourses
with them, yet did not this give occasion to make us suspected
of any such things. Yea, <em>Gaspar Barleus</em>, the <em>Virgill</em> of our
time, and many others, have written many verses in my commendations,
which I mention not, for vain glory (farre be it) but for
vindication of my innocent repute.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. By our rituall books we are clear of this seducing. For if any
man offer to become a <em>Iew</em>, of what Nation soever he be, before we
receive him, and admit him as a member of our Synagogue, we are
bound to consider, whether he be moved by necessity to do it, or
if it be not for that he is in love with some of our nation, or for
any other worldly respect. And when we find no reason to suspect
him, we have yet another obligation upon us, which is, to let him
know the penalties he subjects himself unto, if he breaketh the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Sabbath, or eateth bloud, or fat, which is forbidden <em>Levit.</em> 3.17.
or disannulleth any precept of the Law, as may be seen in the
<em>Targum</em> upon <em>Ruth</em>. And if he shew himself constant, and zealous,
then is he admitted and protected. Wherefore we do not seduce
any one, but contrarily, avoid disputing with men, concerning
religion, not for want of charity, but that we may as farre as it is
possible, avoid scandall, and hate; and for this cause we refuse to
circumcise them that come to us, because we will give no offence.
Yea, I have known some, that for this cause have circumcised
themselves. And if <em>Ferdinand</em> and <em>Isabella</em>, King and Queen of <em>Castile</em>
did make an order to expell the <em>Iewes</em>, because they seduced
many Christians, and some of the Nobility to become <em>Iewes</em>, this
was but a pretence, and colour for their tyranny, and onely, as it
is well known, having no other thing to object against us. Truly,
I do much commend that opinion, not onely of <em>Osorius, de rebus
Immanuelis</em>, but of our <em>Flavius Iosephus</em>, the most famous of all
Historians, which he relates in his history of his own Life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At that time (saith he) there came unto me, two Noble men,
of the <em>Trachomites</em>, subjects of the king; bringing with them
horsemen, with arms, and money. These, when the <em>Iewes</em> would
compell to be circumcised, if they would live amongst them;
I would not suffer them to trouble them; maintaining that every
man ought to serve God, of his own free will, and not be forced
thereto by others. For, should we do this thing (saith he)
it might make them repent, that ever they fled unto us. And so
perswading the multitude, I did abundantly afford unto these
men, their food, according to their diet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Truly, this was an action worthy of a noble, and wise man, and
worthy of imitation, for defending common liberty, leaving the
judgement, and determination to God alone. The <em>Spanish Inquisitions</em>,
with all their torments, and cruelties, cannot make any
<em>Iew</em>, that falls into their power, become a <em>Christian</em>. For unreasonable
beasts are taught by blowes, but men are taught by reason.
Nor are men perswaded to other opinions, by torments, but
rather, on the contrary, they become more firm, and constant in
their Tenet.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
  <h4 class='c013'>THE SIXTH SECTION.</h4>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Having thus discussed the main exceptions, I will now proceed
to smaller matters, though lesse pertaining to my faculty,
that is to businesse of <em>Merchandise</em>. Some say, that
if the <em>Iewes</em> come to dwell here, they will draw unto themselves
the whole Negotiation, to the great damage of the naturall Inhabitants.
I answer, that it hath been my opinion alwayes, (with
submission to better judgements) that it can be no prejudice at
all to the English Nation: because, principally in transporting
their goods, they would gain much, by reason of the publick payments
of customes, excise, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, they would alwayes bring profit to the people of the
land, as well in buying of commodities, which they would transport
to other places, as in those they would trade in here.
And if by accident, any particular person should lose by it, by
bringing down the price of such a commodity, being dispersed
into many hands; yet by that means the Commonwealth would
gain in buying cheaper, and procuring it at a lesser rate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yea, great emolument would grow to the naturall Inhabitants,
as well in the sale of all provision, as in all things else that concern
the ornaments of the body. Yea, and the native Mechanicks
also would gain by it, (there being rarely found among us,
any man that useth any such art.)</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Adde to this, that as our nation hath sailed into almost all
parts of the world, so they are alwayes herein profitable to a nation,
in a readinesse to give their opinions, in favour of the people
amongst whom they live. Beside that, all strangers do bring
in new merchandises, together with the knowledge of those forreign
Countries wherein they were born.</p>

<p class='c007'>And this is so farre from damnifying the natives, that it conduces
much to their advantage; because they bring from their
countryes new commodities, with new knowledge. For the great
Work-Master, and <em>Creatour</em> of all things, to the end, to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>commerce in the earth, gave not to every place all things, but
hath parted his benefits amongst them; by which way, he hath
made them all wanting the help of others. This may be seen in
<em>England</em>, which being one of the most plentifull countries that are
in the world, yet wanteth divers things for <em>shipping</em>; as also, wine,
oyl, figs, almonds, raisins, and all the drougs of <em>India</em>, things
so necessary for the <em>life of man</em>. And besides, they want many other
commodities, which are abundant in other countries, with
more knowledge of them; though it be true, that in my opinion,
there is not in the world, a more understanding people, for most
Navigations, and more capable of all Negotiation, then the <em>English</em>
Nation are.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Farther, there may be companies made of the natives, and
strangers, (where they are more acquainted) or else Factors. All
which, if I be not deceived, will amount to the profit of the natives.
For which, many reasons may be brought, though I cannot
comprehend them, having alwayes lived a sedentary life, applying
my self to my studies, which are farre remote from things
of that nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Nor can it be justly objected against our Nation, that they
are deceivers; because the generality cannot in any rationall way,
be condemned for some particulars. I cannot excuse them all,
nor do I think, but there may be some deceivers amongst them,
as well as amongst all other nations and people, because poverty
bringeth basenesse along with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. But if we look to that which we ought by our Religion,
the morall precept of the Decalogue, <em>Thou shalt not steal</em>, it
belongs in common to all <em>Iewes</em>, towards all <em>Gentiles</em>. As may be
seen in Rab. <em>Moses</em> of <em>Egypt</em>, Tract, <em>Geneba</em>, cap. 1. and <em>Gazela</em>,
cap. 1. <em>It is a sinne</em>, (saith he) <em>to rob any man, though he be a Gentile</em>.
Nor can that be alledged out of the sacred History, concerning
the jewells and houshold stuff, of which the <em>Israelites</em> spoiled the
<em>Egyptians</em>, as I have heard it sometimes alledged by some, to some
men; because that was a particular dispensation, and a divine precept
for that time. So it is recorded in the <em>Talmud</em>, in the <em>Tract of
the Sanhedrim</em>, cap. 11. that in the time of <em>Alexander</em> the great,
those of <em>Alexandria</em> accused the <em>Iewes</em> for being thieves, and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>demanded restitution of their goods. But <em>Guebia Ben Pesria</em> answered
them, our Fathers went down into <em>Egypt</em> but seventy souls,
there they grew a numerous nation, above 60000. and served
them in base offices, for the space of 210 yeares, according to
this, pay us for our labour, and make the accounts even, and you
shall see you are yet much in our debt. The reason satisfied <em>Alexander</em>,
and he acquitted them.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. By consequence, the <em>Iewes</em> are bound not to defraud, nor
abuse in their accounts, negotiation, or reckonings, any man
whatsoever, as it may be seen expresly in R. <em>Moses</em> of <em>Egypt</em>, and
R. <em>Moseh de Kosi</em> in <em>Samag.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>7. Yea, they farther say, that by restitutions, there is a result
to the praise of God, and the sacred Law, whence that holy, and
wise man, R. <em>Simeon Ben Satah</em>, having bought an asse of a Gentile,
the head stall whereof was a jewell of great value, which the owner
knew not of, afterwards he found it, and freely, and for nothing,
he restored it to the seller, that knew not of it, saying, I bought
the asse, but not the jewell. Whence there did accrue honour to
God, and his Law, and to the nation of the <em>Iewes</em>, as <em>Midras Raba</em>
reports in <em>Parasot Hekel</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. After the same manner they command, that the oath which
they shall make to any other nation, must be with truth, and justice,
and must be kept in every particular. And for proof thereof,
they quote the history of <em>Zedekias</em>, whom God punished, and
deprived of his kingdome, because he kept not his word, and
<em>oath</em>, made to <em>Nebuchadnezzar, in the name of God</em>, though he were a
<em>Gentile</em>, as it is said, 2 of <em>Chronicles</em>, cap. 36.13. <em>And he also rebelled
against Nebuchadnezzar, who made him swear by God.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>9. These are the laws and obligations which the <em>Iewes</em> hold.
So that the Law that forbids the <em>Iewes</em> to <em>kill</em> any <em>Gentiles</em>, forbids
them also to <em>steal</em> from them. Yet every one must look to it, for
the world is full of fraud in all Nations. I remember a pretty story
of what passed in <em>Morocco</em>, in the Court of the king of <em>Mauritania</em>.
There was a <em>Iew</em> that had a sort of false stones, <em>&amp;c.</em>—He
making a truck with a <em>Portugal</em> Christian, for some Verdigrease
that he had, which was much sofisticated, (as they are wont to
do there) being all falsified with Earth; one of the <em>Portugals</em> friends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>laughed at him, saying, the <em>Iew</em> fitted thee well; he answered, If
the <em>Iew</em> hath stoned me, I have buried him. And so they ordinarily
mock one another.</p>

<p class='c007'>This I can affirm, that many of the <em>Iewes</em>, because they would
not break with other mens goods, were very poor at <em>Amsterdam</em>,

<p class='c007'>And whereas in the time of K. <em>Edward</em> <span class='fss'>I.</span> the <em>Iewes</em> were accused

<h4 class='c013'>THE SEVENTH SECTION.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>And now by this time, I presume (most noble Sir) I may have
given abundant satisfaction, (so farre as the nature of an
epistle will permit) to all your objections, without giving
just ground of offence, or scandall to any. And forasmuch
as you are further desirous to know somewhat, concerning the
state of this my expedition, and negotiation at present, I shall
now onely say, and that briefly, that the communication and correspondence
I have held, for some yeares since, with some eminent
persons of <em>England</em>, was the first originall of my undertaking this
design. For I alwayes found by them, a great probability of obtaining
what I now request; whilst they affirmed, that at this time
the minds of men stood very well affected towards us; and that
our entrance into this Island, would be very acceptable, and well-pleasing
unto them. And from this beginning sprang up in me a
semblable affection, and desire of obtaining this purpose. For,
for seven yeares on this behalf, I have endeavoured, and sollicited
it, by letters, and other means, without any intervall. For I
conceived, that our universall dispersion was a necessary circumstance,
to be fulfilled, before all that shall be accomplished which
the Lord hath promised to the people of the <em>Iewes</em>, concerning
their restauration, and their returning again into their own land,
according to those words <em>Dan.</em> 12.7. <em>When he shall have accomplished
to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</em>
As also, that this our scattering, by little, and little, should be amongst
all people, from the <em>one end of the earth even unto the other</em>; as
it is written <em>Deut.</em> 28.64. I conceived that by the <em>end of the earth</em>
might be understood this <em>Island</em>. And I knew not, but that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Lord who often works by naturall meanes, might have design’d,
and made choice of me, for the bringing about this work. With
these proposalls therefore, I applyed my self, in all zealous affection
to the <em>English Nation</em>, congratulating their glorious liberty
which at this day they enjoy, together with their prosperous
peace. And I entituled my book named <cite>The hope of Israel</cite>, to the
first Parliament, and the Council of State. And withall declared
my intentions. In order to which they sent me a very favourable
passe-port. Afterwards I directed my self to the second, and
they also sent me another. But at that juncture of time my coming
was not presently performed, for that my kindred and
friends, considering the checquered, and interwoven vicissitudes,
and turns of things here below, embracing me, with pressing importunity,
earnestly requested me not to part from them, and
would not give over, till their love constrained me to promise,
that I would yet a while stay with them. But notwithstanding all
this, I could not be at quiet in my mind, (I know not but that it
might be through some particular divine providence) till I had
anew made my humble addresses to his Highnesse the Lord Protector
(whom God preserve.) And finding that my coming over
would not be altogether unwelcome to him, with those great
hopes which I conceived, I joyfully took my leave of my house,
my friends, my kindred, all my advantages there, and the country
wherein I have lived all my life time, under the benign protection,
and favour of the Lords, the States Generall, and Magistrates
of <em>Amsterdam</em>; <em>in fine</em> (I say) I parted with them all, and
took my voyage for <em>England</em>. Where, after my arrivall, being very
courteously received, and treated with much respect, I presented
to his most Serene Highnesse, a petition, and some desires,
which for the most part, were written to me by my brethren the
<em>Iewes</em>, from severall parts of <em>Europe</em>, as your worship may better
understand by former relations. Whereupon it pleased his Highnesse
to convene an Assembly at <em>Whitehall</em>, of Divines, Lawyers,
and Merchants, of different perswasions, and opinions. Whereby
mens judgements, and sentences were different. Insomuch, that
as yet, we have had no finall determination from his most Serene
Highnesse. Wherefore those few <em>Iewes</em> that were here, despairing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>of our expected successe, departed hence. And others who desired
to come hither, have quitted their hopes, and betaken themselves
some to <em>Italy</em>, some to <em>Geneva</em>, where that Commonwealth
hath at this time, most freely granted them many, and great priviledges.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, O most high God, to thee I make my prayer, even to
thee, the God of our Fathers. Thou who hast been pleased to stile
thy self <em>the keeper of Israel</em>; Thou who hast graciously promised,
by thy holy Prophet <em>Ieremiah</em>, (cap. 31.) <em>that thou wilt not cast off
all the seed of Israel, for all the evill that they have done</em>; thou who
by so many stupendious miracles, didst bring thy people out of <em>Egypt</em>,
the land of bondage, and didst lead them into the <em>holy land</em>;
graciously cause thy holy influence to descend down into the
mind of the Prince, (who for no private interest, or respect at all,
but onely out of commiseration to our affliction, hath inclined
himself to protect, and shelter us, for which extraordinary humanity,
neither I my self, nor my nation, can ever expect to be able
to render him answerable, and sufficient thanks,) and also into
the minds of his most illustrious and prudent Council, that they
may determine that, which according to thine infinite wisdome,
may be best, and most expedient for us. For men (O Lord) see
that which is present, but thou in thy omnisciencie seest that
which is afarre off.</p>

<p class='c007'>And to the highly honoured nation of <em>England</em>, I make my most
humble request, that they would read over my arguments impartially,
without prejudice, and devoid of all passion, effectually
recommending me to their grace and favour, and earnestly beseeching
God that he would be pleased to hasten the time promised
by <em>Zephaniah</em>, wherein we shall all serve him <em>with one consent</em>,
after the same manner, and shall be all of the same judgement, that
as his name is one, so his fear may be also one, and that we may all
see the goodnesse of the Lord, blessed for ever, and the consolations
of Zion. Amen, and Amen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pocock, in his biographical introduction to the English translation of
Menasseh ben Israel’s “De Termino Vitæ” (Lond., 1700), gives the
following pen-picture of the author derived from the recollections of
English Jews who remembered the days of the Whitehall Conferences:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was of middle stature and inclining to fatness. He always used his
own hair, which (many years before his death) was very grey; so that his
complexion being pretty fresh, his demeanour graceful and comely, his habit
plain and decent, he commanded an awful reverence which was partly due to
so venerable a deportment. In short, he was <em>un homme sans passion, sans
legiereté, mais hélas! sans opulence</em>” (p. viii).</p>

<p class='c007'>This description agrees with the portraits of Menasseh. Three of
these portraits are extant. Two of them are by Rembrandt, and one is
by a Jewish line-engraver, Salom Italia. Curiously enough, although far
inferior in artistic merit to the Rembrandts as a portrait, Menasseh prized
the Italia engraving highest. He sent a copy to the Silesian mystic
Frankenberg in 1643, and he writes in the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bonum Nuncium Israeli</span></cite>:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abr. à Frankenberg&nbsp;... effigiem meam, aeri incisam misissem, ubi
ad symbolum meum Perigrinando Quærimus, cui ab uno latere Hominis
Peregrinantis, ab altero candelæ emblema adscriptum cum hoc dicterio
<span lang='iw' xml:lang='ar' dir='rtl'>נר לרגלי דברך</span> sic praefatur</span>” (p. <a href='#Page_92'>92</a>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The shield in the left-hand corner of this portrait was used by Menasseh
as a trade-mark in his printing-office. It has for this reason been
reproduced on the title-page of the present work. Salom Italia’s portrait is
often found bound up with the first Latin version of the “Hope of Israel,”
and was roughly copied in the Spanish edition published at Madrid in 1881.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rembrandt belonged to the distinguished circle of Menasseh’s personal
friends. He illustrated the <em>Piedra Gloriosa</em> published by Menasseh in 1655,
and he etched one portrait of the Rabbi, and painted another. The
etching, of which a mezzotinted reproduction is presented on the frontispiece
of the present work, was produced in 1636 when Menasseh was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>thirty-two years old. The painted portrait which is in the Hermitage at
St. Petersburg is of doubtful authenticity as relating to Menasseh, but I am
inclined to regard it as genuine. It represents the Rabbi at a much more
advanced age than the etching. The grey hair agrees with Pocock’s description
of his appearance in 1656, while the sorrowful expression and full
beard may be accounted for by his troubled experiences in London, and
especially by the death of his son. When he returned to Middleburg in
1657, he was mourning for his son, and hence his beard would be unshaved.
It is not at all improbable that Rembrandt, his old friend of twenty years,
saw him at this tragical moment, and that the portrait is a reminiscence of
the prematurely aged and broken-hearted Rabbi, then tottering on the verge
of the grave.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Bibliographical Note</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>The title is taken from Jeremiah xiv. 8 (see p. <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The first edition (pp. xiii, 126, 12mo) was in Spanish, and bore the
following title:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang='iw' xml:lang='ar' dir='rtl'>מקוה ישראל</span> / <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Esto es, / Esperança / de Israel. / Obra con suma
curiosidad conpuesta / por / Menasseh Ben Israel / Theologo, y Philosopho
Hebreo. / Trata del admirable esparzimiento de los diez / Tribus, y su
infalible reduccion con los de / mas, a la patria: con muchos puntos, / y
Historias curiosas, y declara- / cion de varias Prophecias, / por el Author
rectamen- / te interpretadas. / Dirigido a los señores Parnassim del K.K. /
de Talmvd Tora. / En Amsterdam. / En la Imprension de / Semvel Ben
Israel Soeiro. / Año. 5410.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>It was dedicated to the Wardens of the Theological School (Talmud
Torah), Josseph Da Costa, Ishak Jessurun, Michael Espinosa, Abraham
Enriques Faro, Gabriel de Rivas Altas, Ishak Belmonte, and Abraham
Franco. The dedication is dated Shebat 13, 5410 [= Jan. 15, 1650],
and is headed with the significant quotation in Hebrew of part of verse 1
of Isaiah lxi.: “To preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me
to bind up the broken-hearted.” This dedicatory epistle is only to be
found in the Spanish edition. In the Latin and English translations it
is replaced by an address “To the Parliament, the Supream Court of
England.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Latin edition (pp. xii, 111, 12mo), which was printed very shortly
after the Spanish, bore the following title:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang='iw' xml:lang='ar' dir='rtl'>מקוה ישראל</span> / <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoc est, / Spes / Israelis / Authore / Menasseh Ben
Israel / Theologo &amp; Philosopho Hebræo / Amstelodami / Anno 1650.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>It is doubtful whether Kayserling (<em>Misc. Heb. Lit.</em>, ii. p. 16 and
note 76), following Castro, is correct in his conjecture that this translation
is the work of Menasseh himself. There are too many misunderstandings
of the Hebrew names and quotations to admit of this view. The deviations
from the original suggest that it was hurriedly executed from a
first draft of the Spanish version, which was afterwards revised by the
author, who omitted to perform the same service for the Latin text.</p>

<p class='c007'>The English version (pp. xiv, 90, 12mo) was based on the Latin, and
reproduced all its faults. It appeared in London towards the end of 1650.
The title-page runs as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The / Hope of Israel: / Written / By Menasseh Ben Israel, / an
Hebrew Divine, and Philosopher. / Newly extant, and Printed in /
Amsterdam, and Dedicated by the / Author to the High Court, the /
Parliament of England, and to the / Councell of State. / Translated into
English, and / published by Authority. / In this treatise is shewed the
place where the ten / Tribes at this present are, proved, partly by / the
strange relation of one Antony Monte- / zinus, a Jew, of what befell him
as he tra- / veiled over the Mountaines Cordillære, with / divers other
particulars about the restoration of / the Jewes, and the time when. /
Printed at London by R. I. for Hannah Allen, / at the Crown in Popeshead
/ Alley, 1650.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only respect in which this version differs from the Latin is that it
contains on pp. xi-xiv an address from “The Translator to the Reader.”
The name of the translator is not given, but the work was subsequently
acknowledged by Moses Wall in a correspondence with E. S. (Sir Edward
Spencer); see pp. <a href='#Page_66'>66</a>–72.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second edition, “corrected and amended,” sm. 4to, was published
in 1651 and reprinted in 1652. It is the latter which is reproduced in the
present volume on account of its convenient <em>format</em>, and of the Appendices
which throw light on the motives by which the publication in England
was actuated.</p>

another blessing said on seeing “negroes and redskins,” and this,

Rabbi Simeon was a famous doctor of the Mishna and disciple of
Akiba. He laid the foundation of the Sifre, the Halachic, or legal

legend as the greatest master of the Cabbala. He was not the
author of the Zohar. Internal evidence stamps that work as a
product of the thirteenth century, and its authorship is now ascribed to
Moses ben Shemtob de Leon (Hamburger, “Real-Encyclopädie,”

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Bibliographical Note</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>For the origin of this tract, and the probable date and circumstances of
its preparation, see Introduction, pp. xxxviii-xxxix.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two editions, neither of which bears any imprint or date.
Both are 4to, but one has 26 pp. and the other 23 pp. It is difficult to say
whether, and which, one of these two versions is a revision of the other, as
the only difference between them is that the following sentence is added at
the end of the 23 pp. text: “Which is the close of Rabbi Menesse Ben-Israel,
a Divine, and Doctor in Physick in the Strand over against the New-Exchange
in London.” The British Museum copy of this edition is dated
in MS. “Novemb. 5th (London), 1655.” This edition must have been
printed after Menasseh’s arrival in London, and it is probable that the other
is the <em>Libellus Anglicus</em> of which he speaks in his letter to Felgenhauer in
February 1655, and which, consequently, we may assume was printed in
Amsterdam.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>The latter was reprinted in Melbourne in 1868, with an introduction by
the late Rev. A. F. Ornstien:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“To / His Highnesse / the / Lord Protector / of the / Commonwealth
of / England, Scotland and Ireland / the Humble Addresses / of / Menasseh
Ben Israel, a Divine, and / Doctor of Physic, in behalfe / of the Jewish
Nation / 1655. / Reprinted by H. T. Dwight, / Bookseller and Publisher,
Bourke Street East, Melbourne, / 1868.”</p>

<p class='c007'>English reprints of the 23 pp. text have been published in the <em>Jewish
Chronicle</em>, Nov.-Dec. 1859, and in Kayserling’s “Life of Menasseh ben
Israel,” with annotations in 1877 (<em>Miscellany of Hebrew Literature</em>, Second
Series, pp. 35–63). According to Barbosa Machado (“Biblioteca Lusitana,”
vol. iii. p. 457) a Spanish translation was published in London simultaneously
with the first English edition. Its title is given as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Las Humildes suplicaciones En nombre de la Nacion de los Judios a
su Alteza el Señor Protector Oliver Cromwell de la Republica de Inglaterra,
Scocia, y Yrlandia. Traduzido del Original Ingles. En Londres, 1655.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A copy of this translation in MS. existed in the library of Isaac da
Costa of Amsterdam (<em>Misc. Heb. Lit.</em>, ii. p. 84). Kayserling first
translated the tract into German, and published it in his “Menasse ben
Israel, sein Leben und Wirken” (Berlin, 1861).</p>

<p class='c007'>A very large number of the historical references in this tract are taken
without acknowledgment from Imanuel Aboab’s “Nomologia” (Amst.,
1629) and Daniel Levy de Barrios’s “Historia Universal Judayca.”
Kayserling has given many of the original passages in his notes to his “Life
of Menasseh ben Israel” (<em>Misc. Heb. Lit.</em>, Series II.).</p>

<p class='c030'>P. <a href='#Page_81'>81</a>, l. 19. “<em>Merchandizing is&nbsp;... the proper profession of the Nation

genius for commerce this is a vulgar error (see Loeb, “Le Juif

<p class='c030'>P. <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>, l. 16. “<em>As the Chronicles do declare.</em>” This paragraph is
almost literally translated from Aboab’s “Nomologia,” p. 290. The
story does not appear in the earlier Jewish chronicles, such as <em>Schevet
Jehuda</em>, <em>Emek Habacha</em>, and <em>Zemach David</em>, although the events of
the reign of Pedro the Cruel and Don Enrique so far as they affect
the Jew are fully dealt with in them. The “Chronicle” referred
to by Menasseh is probably that of Pedro Lopez d’Ayala, which is
the original authority for the story.</p>

of this, and the following paragraphs relating to the expulsion from
Spain, is taken from Aboab’s “Nomologia.” Osorius (Hieronymo
Osorio, 1506–1580) was author of a history of the reign of King
Emanuel, which was translated into English by Gibbs (Lond.,
1752). See notes to Kayserling’s “Menasseh” for parallel
passages from Aboab.</p>

<p class='c030'>P. <a href='#Page_99'>99</a>, l. 22. “<em>As Vasquo saith.</em>” For Vasquo read Usque. Menasseh is
quoting from the “Consolacam as Tribvlacoens de Ysrael,” by Samuel
Usque (Ferrara, 1552), see pp. 198–200. Samuel Usque was one
of three brothers, all distinguished Marranos. He fled from the
Portuguese Inquisition and settled at Ferrara, whence he emigrated
to the Holy Land. He was a protégé of Donna Gracia Nasi (see
Note on “Don Josephus Nassi,” <em>supra</em>, p. 159; also Kayserling,
“Jüdischen Frauen,” pp. 80–86).</p>

<p class='c030'>P. <a href='#Page_100'>100</a>, l. 5. The narrative as pirated from Aboab’s “Nomologia”

<p class='c030'>P. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>, l. 20. “<em>As for the third point.</em>” Menasseh himself was largely
responsible for the charge of proselytising, inasmuch as in the “Hope
of Israel” (<em>supra</em>, p. 47) he had boasted of the converts made by
the Jews in Spain. There can be no doubt that these conversions
were very numerous, but they were probably due in a larger measure
to the oppressive policy of the Inquisition than to any active proselytising
on the part of the Jews.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the origin of this tract see Introduction, pp. lxii-lxiv.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has often been reprinted and translated, especially on occasions of
Jewish persecution. In 1708 it reappeared in the second volume of “The
Phœnix; or a Revival of Scarce and Valuable Pieces.” In 1743 it was reprinted
as an independent pamphlet (Lond., 8vo, pp. 67). Ninety-five
years later it was again reprinted by M. Samuels in the prolegomena to
his translation of Moses Mendelssohn’s “Jerusalem” (Lond., 1838, vol. i.
pp. <a href='#Page_1'>1</a>–73), together with a translation of Mendelssohn’s introduction to the
German edition (pp. 77–116).</p>

<p class='c007'>On the Continent it was first published in 1782 in connection with the
Mendelssohnian movement for Jewish emancipation, which was participated
in by Lessing and Dohm. The fact that it should have been considered
by Moses Mendelssohn worthy to stand by the side of Lessing’s <em>Nathan der
Weise</em> is a striking tribute to its merits. The Mendelssohnian issue is more
famous than the original English edition, for in its German form the work
became a classic of national Jewish controversy, whereas in English it was
only associated with the local history of the British Jews. The following
is the full title of the German edition (pp. lii, 64, sm. 8vo):—</p>

<p class='c007'>Manasseh Ben Israel / Rettung der Juden / Aus dem Englischen
übersetzt / Nebst einer Vorrede / von / Moses Mendelssohn./ Als ein
Anhang / zu des / Hrn. Kriegsraths Dohm / Abhandlung: / Ueber / die
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>bürgerliche Verbesserung / der Juden./ Mit Königl. Preussischer allergnädigster
Freyheit./ Berlin und Stettin / bey Friedrich Nicolai / 1782.</p>

<p class='c007'>This translation is said to have been made by Dr. Herz, the husband of
the famous Henrietta Herz (Kayserling, “Moses Mendelssohn sein Leben
und seine Werke,” p. 354), but it was probably done by his wife, who knew
English so well that during her widowhood she was engaged to teach it to
the daughter of the Duchess of Courland. (See “Life” by Fürst, also
Jennings’s “Rahel,” pp. 19 <em>et seq.</em>) The introduction supplied by Moses
Mendelssohn fills fifty-two pages, and is as famous as the <em>Vindiciæ</em> itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides being reprinted in Mendelssohn’s collected works, the German
edition of the <em>Vindiciæ</em> was republished in 1882, in connection with the
Anti-Semitic agitation, under the title “Gegen die Verleumder,” and again
in 1890.</p>

<h4 class='c013'><span class='sc'>The First Section</span></h4>

<p class='c033'>P. <a href='#Page_108'>108</a>, l. 11. “<em>The Jews are wont to celebrate the feast of unleavened
bread, fermenting it with the blood of some Christians.</em>” This accusation,
now known as the Blood Accusation, has been for many centuries
the favourite superstition of the Jew-haters. It was revived by
Prynne and Ross during Menasseh’s sojourn in London. During
the residence of the Jews in England previously to 1290, it played a
conspicuous part in their persecution. (See Joseph Jacobs’ “Little
St. Hugh of Lincoln,” <em>Jew. Hist. Soc. Trans.</em>, vol. i., especially pp.
92–99. “The Blood Accusation, its origin and occurrence in the
Middle Ages,” reprinted from the <em>Jewish Chronicle</em>, 1883.) There is
a very voluminous literature of the Blood Accusation (see especially
Zunz’s “Damaskus, ein Wort zur Abwehr,” Berlin, 1859), but it
has not hitherto been noticed that during the period the Jews were
banished from England (1290–1655) the superstition continued to
haunt the public mind. We have a curious instance of it in 1577.
When John Foxe, the martyrologist, baptized a Moorish Jew named
Nathaniel Menda, on April 1 of that year, at All Hallows, Lombard
Street, he adopted the Blood Accusation in the address he delivered
to celebrate the occasion. “Moreover, if he (Abraham) had seene
your unappeaceable disorder without all remorse of mercy in persecuting
his (Jesus’s) disciples; your intolerable scorpionlike savageness,
so furiously boyling against the innocent infants of the Christian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Gentiles:&nbsp;... would he ever accompted you for his sonnes.” To
which the printer’s gloss runs thus: “Christen men’s children here
in Englande crucified by the Jewes, Anno 1189 and Anno 1141 at
Norwiche, &amp;c.” (John Foxe, “A Sermon at the Christening of a
certaine Iew at London,” London, 1578; p. E. iii.) This sermon,
originally delivered in Latin, was translated into English and published
<em>in extenso</em>, together with the confession of Nathaniel Menda, in 1578.
It was dedicated to Sir Francis Walsingham, Principal Secretary of
State to Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p class='c030'>Thomas Calvert, “Minister of the Word at York,” was the next
to lend his name to the superstition, and to give vigorous expression
to it in his “Diatraba of the Jews’ Estate.” This was a preface to
“The Blessed Jew of Marocco; or A Blackmoor made White, by
Rabbi Samuel, a Jew turned Christian; written first in the Arabick,
after translated into Latin, and now Englished” (York, 1648.
The British Museum copy is dated in MS. “July 25, 1649.”)
His exact words are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“So much are they (the Jews) bent to shed the blood of
Christians, that they say a Jew needs no repentance for murdering a
Christian; and they add to that sinne to make it sweet and delectable
that hee who doth it, it is as if he had offered a <em>Corban</em> to the Lord,
hereby making the abominable sin an acceptable sacrifice. But beyond
all these they have a bloody thirst after the blood of Christians. In
France and many kingdoms they have used yearly to steale a Christian
boy and to crucifie him, fastning him to a crosse, giving him gall and
vinegar, and running him in the end thorow with a spear, to rub their
memories afresh into sweet thoughts of their crucifying Christ, the
more to harden themselves against Christ and to shew their curst
hatred to all Christians” (pp. 18–19).</p>

<p class='c030'>John Sadler stands out conspicuously for dissociating himself
from this baseless prejudice. When he wrote his “Rights of
the Kingdom,” in 1649, he summed up the matter in a happy and
pithy manner: “Wee say, they (the Jews) crucified a child, or more.
They doe deny it: and we prove it not” (p. 74). Undaunted by
Sadler’s championship of the Jews, James Howell followed Calvert,
and in the Epistle Dedicatory to his pirated edition of Morvyn’s translation
of Joseph ben Gorion, “The wonderful and deplorable history
of the latter times of the Jews” (London [June 2], 1652), he
thus insinuated the truth of the charge:—</p>

<p class='c030'>“The first Christian Prince that expelled the Jews out of his
territories, was that heroik King, our Edward the First, who was
such a sore scourge also to the Scots; and it is thought divers families
of those banished Jews fled then to Scotland, where they have propagated
since in great numbers, witness the aversion that nation hath
above others to hog’s flesh. Nor was this extermination for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Religion, but for their notorious crimes, as poysoning of wells, counterfeiting
of coines, falsifying of seales, and <em>crucifying of Christian children</em>,
with other villanies.”</p>

<p class='c030'>Sadler was not the only English contemporary of Menasseh ben
Israel who threw doubt on the Blood Accusation. Prynne himself
relates in the preface to his “Demurrer” that he met Mr. Nye by
the garden wall at Whitehall, when he was on his way to the Conference
on the Jewish Question. “I told him,” writes Prynne,
“the Jews had been formerly clippers and forgers of money, <em>and had
crucified three or four children in England at least</em>, which were principal
causes of their banishment, to which he replied, that the crucifying
of children was not fully charged on them by our historians, and
would easily be wiped off.” (Preface, p. 4.)</p>

<p class='c030'>It is curious that, as Menasseh himself points out, the Jews were
not alone at this period as sufferers from the Blood Accusation.
(“Humble Addresses,” p. 21.) Apart from the instance quoted
by Menasseh, a similar charge was levelled at the Quakers, who
were accused of the ritual murder of women. An illustrated tract
on the subject will be found in <em>Historia Fanaticorum</em>. (See “Historia
von den Wider-Tauffern,” Cöthen, 1701.)</p>

<p class='c030'>The Blood Accusation did not again make a conspicuous appearance
in Anglo-Jewish history, but it is not improbable that the
Damascus trials in 1840 produced a serious effect in retarding the
progress of the struggle for emancipation. On the Continent, and in
the Levant, it has frequently reappeared during the last thirty years.</p>

<p class='c030'>P. <a href='#Page_112'>112</a>, l. 16. “<em>And every day the Jewes mainly strike.</em>” The belief
that Jews habitually desecrated the sacramental wafer runs parallel
with the Blood Accusation. A curious echo of it was heard in
1822, and the published account of the case was illustrated by George
Cruikshank (“The Miraculous Host tortured by the Jews,” Lond.,
1822).</p>

<p class='c030'>P. <a href='#Page_114'>114</a>, l. 4. “<em>Wherefore I swear.</em>” This oath is famous in Jewish

“Hope of Israel” (<em>supra</em>, p. 7), Menasseh announced his intention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>of writing this work. From this passage it seems that he had now
completed it, and that he had the MS. with him in London. It
was never printed, as none of it has survived. It is curious that
Menasseh does not mention it among his “Books ready for the

the Thirteen Articles of Faith first drawn up by Moses Maimonides
in 1168, and now incorporated in the Synagogue liturgy. Menasseh’s
summary, though admirably succinct, is not altogether perfect, and
was apparently drafted with a view to the susceptibilities of the
English Conversionists. A full translation of the thirteen creeds
had, however, already appeared in England (see Chilmead’s translation
of Leo Modena’s “The History of the Rites, Customes, and
Manner of Life of the Present Jews,” Lond., 1650, pp. 246–249).</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r40'>40</a>. This tract has been the source of a curious misunderstanding. Kayserling,
who apparently never examined more of it than the title-page, on which the
author is described as “E. S. Middlesex,” ascribed it to “Lord Middlesex,”
and regarded it as favourable to Menasseh (<cite>Misc. Heb. Lit.</cite>, ii. p. 33). Had
he looked at the Latin translation at the end he would have found the name
of the author given in full. Moreover, the writer, so far from being philo-Semitic,
expressly states that the object of his pamphlet was the “taking off
the scandall of our too great desire of entertayning the unbeleeving Nation
of the Jewes.” Kayserling’s errors have been adopted without inquiry by
Graetz, Adler, and other writers.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r68'>68</a>. Jacob Sasportas, who had acted as a “corrector” in Menasseh’s printing-office
in Amsterdam, and was afterwards elected Chief Rabbi in London,
was a member of the mission (Graetz, vol. x. notes, p. xix). Raguenet
states (<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire d’Oliver Cromwell</span></cite>, p. 290) that two other Rabbis accompanied
it, “Rabbi Jacob ben Azahel” and “David ben Eliezer of Prague.”
I have not been able to identify these persons, but tentatively I am disposed
to think that “Azahel” is a corruption of “Heschel,” and that the person
referred to is Rabbi Josua ben Jacob Heschel of Lublin. Menasseh’s
elder son lived for some time in Lublin, and it is quite possible that Heschel
came to London to lay the case of the persecuted Polish Jews before
Cromwell.</p>

S. Levy believes (<cite>Trans. Jew. Hist. Soc.</cite>, iii. p. 152) that this opinion was

from the resemblances between Barlow’s recommendations and the report

the opinion was submitted to the Whitehall Conference, and Boyle was not a
member of that body. Goodwin, who was President of Magdalen College,

The disappearance of these documents is not surprising, as many of
the older documents belonging to the Sephardi congregation in London
passed into private hands. Moreover, after the Restoration the congregations
would naturally wish to destroy all evidence of their negotiations with
the Protector. It is probable that these documents are referred to in the
State Papers, where mention is made of “a Jew living in London who has
produced great testimonies under the hand of the late Lord Protector.”

at the settlement. The prohibition of proselytising has always
been remembered as one of the conditions of the Readmission, and it was
religiously observed until the Rabbinate of the present ecclesiastical chief of
the Anglo-Jewish community. In 1752, when certain Ashkenazi Jews were
making proselytes in London, the Parnassim of the Portuguese synagogue
wrote to the authorities of the German congregation, calling their attention
to this condition, and the proselytisers were ordered to desist from “pursuing
such unlawful practices.” In 1760 a Jew was expelled from the
synagogue and deprived of his burial rights for this offence. (Minute Books
